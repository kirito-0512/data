Pope Boniface VI (Latin: Bonifatius VI; 806 â€“ April 896) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States in April 896. He was a native of Rome.[2] His election came about as a result of riots soon after the death of Pope Formosus. Prior to his reign, he had twice incurred a sentence of deprivation of orders as a subdeacon and as a priest.[3] After a pontificate of fifteen days, he is said by some to have died of the gout,[3] by others to have been forcibly ejected to make way for Stephen VI, the candidate of the Spoletan party.[4]
At a synod in Rome held by John IX in 898, his election was pronounced null and void.[3]
Little is written about the life of Boniface VI. It is believed by historians that he was born to a man called Adrian, who was also a bishop.[5] He then likely served as a sub-deacon or priest before his election to the papacy. [5]
