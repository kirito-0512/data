Year 162 (CLXII) was a common year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. In the Roman Empire, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Rusticus[1] and Plautius (or, less frequently, year 915 Ab urbe condita).[2]
The denomination 162 AD for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
