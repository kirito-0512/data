The University of Bergen (Norwegian: Universitetet i Bergen, Urban East Norwegian: [ʉnɪvæʂɪˈtèːtə ɪ ˈbæ̀rɡn̩]) is a research-intensive state university located in Bergen, Norway. As of 2021, the university has over 4,000 employees and 19,000 students.[1] It was established by an act of parliament in 1946 based on several older scientific institutions dating back to 1825, and is Norway's second oldest university. It is considered one of Norway's four "established universities" and has faculties and programmes in all the fields of a classical university including fields that are traditionally reserved by law for established universities, including medicine and law.[2] It is also one of Norway's leading universities in many natural sciences, including marine research and climate research. It is consistently ranked in the top one percentage among the world's universities, usually among the best 200 universities[3] and among the best 10 or 50 universities worldwide in some fields such as earth and marine sciences.[4][5] It is part of the Coimbra Group and of the U5 group of Norway's oldest and highest ranked universities.
The university traces its roots to several earlier scientific and scholarly institutions founded in Bergen. Academic activity had taken place in Bergen since the founding of Bergen Cathedral School in 1153, the Seminarium Fredericianum in 1750 and the establishment of the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy in 1817. Academia and higher education would also be significantly advanced in the city with the establishment of Bergen Museum, later renamed University Museum of Bergen, in 1825. Founded by Wilhelm Frimann Christie and Jacob Neumann, the museum became a venue for both research and education specialized on natural science, and featured prominent researcher like Michael Sars, Daniel Cornelius Danielssen and Fridtjof Nansen.[6]
Bergen would eventually become a city with several arenas for higher education and research with the Geophysical Institute being established in 1917, the Chr. Michelsen Institute in 1930, the Norwegian School of Economics in 1936 and finally the university in 1946.[7] The University of Bergen was established by an act of parliament in 1946, as Norway's second university.
The University of Bergen has three strategic areas
Within these areas, UiB will contribute to society with excellent research, education, interdisciplinary cooperation and dissemination of knowledge and innovation.
The University of Bergen has an elected rector. The current rector is Margareth Hagen, who was elected rector for a four-year term starting August 1, 2021 after serving as interim rector from January 7, 2021.[8] The university has 7 faculties, the newest being The Faculty of Fine Art, Music and Design which was established in 2017.[9] The University of Bergen Library and the University Museum of Bergen have a faculty-like status. Most of the university campus and administration is located in the Nygård neighbourhood, which has resulted in the campus area often being referred to as Nygårdshøyden or simply Høyden, meaning "the hill".
In 2010 the university was ranked as number 135 worldwide by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[12] and 181st worldwide by the 2015/16 QS World University Rankings.[13] UiB was also ranked number 148 worldwide in the July 2010 Webometrics Ranking of World Universities.[14] The URAP (University Ranking by Academic Performance) has ranked UiB for 2014/2015 as the 219th worldwide.[15]
The University of Bergen, in common with other Norwegian universities, does not charge tuition fees,[16] which also applies to international students. Students are however required to be members of the student welfare organisation. As of 2022, this fee (semesteravgift) is NOK 590 (approx. 70 USD) per semester, and provides access to several services, including cultural activities, childcare, refunds for many medical expenses and subsidized accommodation. 40kr of the fee is a donation to the SAIH, a student charity, but this is optional. However most of the students give the donation.
The Faculty of Fine Art, Music and Design was established on 1 January 2017. It is composed of the earlier Grieg Academy – Department of Music, and the Bergen Academy of Art and Design.
The faculty revised its structure and names in August 2007.
The Faculty of Law was established as a separate faculty in 1980, with legal studies and research having been conducted at the university since 1969. The faculty is one of three Norwegian institutions which offer legal studies, the other two being the law faculties at the University of Oslo and the University of Tromsø. The faculty offers a five-year programme leading to a Master's degree in law and a three-year PhD programme, and currently has approximately 1900 students.
As of January 1, 2018, the faculty is organised into the following seven departments:
