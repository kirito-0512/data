In the latter stages of the war, he was sent to the Pacific Far East to serve with the United States Office for Strategic Services.[5]
Schaffner returned to the United States after the war. He worked for a world peace organization, then as an assistant director for the documentary film series The March of Time. He became a director in the news and public affairs department of CBS television, where his jobs including covering sports, beauty pageants and public-service programs.[6]

He directed "Thunder on Sycamore Street" by Reginald Rose for Studio One.[10] He and Rose reunited on  Twelve Angry Men which won Schaffner an Emmy for Best Director.
The following year Schaffner earned another Emmy for his work on the 1955 TV adaptation of the Broadway play The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial, shown on the anthology series Ford Star Jubilee.[11]
Schaffner became one of three regular directors on the Kaiser Aluminium Hour; the others were George Roy Hill and Fielder Cook.[12] He was also a regular director on Playhouse 90.[13]
He was the original director on the series, The Defenders, created by Rose. Schaffner's work earned him another Emmy.[14]
In 1960, he directed Allen Drury's stage play Advise and Consent. This earned him the Best Director recognition in the Variety Critics Poll.[15]
In the realm of network television, Schaffner also received widespread critical acclaim in 1962 for his groundbreaking collaboration with the First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Kennedy and CBS television's Musical Director Alfredo Antonini in the production of A Tour of the White House with Mrs. John F. Kennedy, a television special broadcast to over 80 million viewers worldwide.[16]
Schaffner's contributions in this production earned him a nomination in 1963 by the Directors Guild of America, for its award in the category of Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Television.[17]
In January 1960 Schaffner signed a multi picture deal with Columbia Pictures.[18]
In May 1961 he signed to make A Summer Place at 20th Century Fox with Fabian and Dolores Hart.[19] The film was not made. Schaffner directed The Good Years (1962) for TV with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball.[20] Other TV work included The Great American Robbery.[21]
Instead Schaffner's first motion picture was The Stripper (1963), made at Fox from a play by William Inge, starring Richard Beymer and Joanne Woodward. The film was well-received critically, but not a commercial success.
He continued to work for TV including The Legend of Lylah Clare.[22]
Schaffner later made The Best Man (1964) based on a play by Gore Vidal and The War Lord (1965), based on a play by Leslie Stevens, with Charlton Heston.

Schaffner had a huge critical and commercial hit in Planet of the Apes (1968) starring Heston at 20th Century Fox.
In December 1968 Schaffner signed a non-exclusive three-picture deal with Columbia.[26]
His next film was for 20th Century Fox, however: Patton (1970), a biopic of General Patton starring George C. Scott. It was a major success for which Schaffner won the Academy Award for Best Director and the Directors Guild of America Award for Best Director.
He made Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) for producer Sam Spiegel. It was an expensive box-office failure. Schaffner followed it with Papillon (1973) a $14 million epic with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman that was a considerable financial success.[27] In 1971 he said his films "are  almost always about people who are out of their time and place."[28]
Schaffner intended to follow Papillon with Dynasty of Western Outlaws, about outlaws over the years in Missouri from a script by John Gay, and an adaptation of The French Lieutenant's Woman.[28] He ended up making neither: Dynasty was never made, and French Lieutenant was made a decade later by another director.

His later films included Sphinx (1981), a $10 million thriller about Egypt based on a novel by Robin Cook and produced by Stanley O'Toole, who had made Boys from Brazil with Schaffner.[30] It was a commercial and critical failure, as was Yes, Giorgio (1982), a musical comedy starring Luciano Pavarotti.
Schaffner's last films were the critically well-received Lionheart (1987) and Welcome Home (1989).
Schaffner was president of the Directors Guild of America from 1987 until his death in 1989.

Schaffner died on July 2, 1989, at the age of 69.[35] He was released 10 days before his death from a hospital where he was being treated for lung cancer.
Screenwriter William Goldman identified Schaffner in 1981 as being one of the three best directors (then living) at handling "scope" (a gift for screen epics) in films. The other two were David Lean and Richard Attenborough.[36]
In 1991, Schaffner's widow, Jean Schaffner, established the Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal (colloquially known as the Franklin J.
