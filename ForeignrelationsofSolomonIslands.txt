Relations with Australia were, until recently,[when?] strained, with prime minister Manasseh Sogavare, accusing Australia of "heavy-handed" interference in Solomon Islands' domestic affairs, subsequently expelling Australia's high commissioner Patrick Cole. In a nationally televised address, Sogavare claimed that the Australian-led security forces in Solomon Islands had not dealt properly with the country's underlying problems.[21]
"We are concerned that Canberra's policies are aimed at excluding and containing the peoples of the region, instead of working collectively to address fundamental problems of social instability that can only be solved through dialogue, rather than the use of development aid, and political force as leverage, to dictate Australia's involvement"Sogavare also claimed that Australia's involvement in the region could be "driving this country down the path of another conflict that could be more serious" than the April 2006 riots that broke out after an election won by the former deputy prime minister Snyder Rini, when thousands of anti-government protesters burned down buildings in Solomon Islands' capital Honiara's Chinese district, alleging that either the People's Republic of China or the Republic of China had paid lawmakers to vote for Rini.[22]
Sogavare's successor, prime minister Derek Sikua, almost immediately set out to mend relations with Australia upon assuming office in December 2007.[23]

This acknowledgement came after a draft of the security agreement was leaked online. In response, the Australian and New Zealand Governments expressed concerns that the establishment of a Chinese military presence in the Solomon Islands would have serious implications for peace and security in the Pacific region.[32][33][34] In response, the Chinese Government defended law enforcement and bilateral cooperation with the Solomon Islands and disputed Australian criticism that Beijing was coercing the Solomon Islands.[35]

The Solomons Chief of Staff, Robert Iroga, objected to the GCSB's tapping of his government's internal communications, which in his view damaged New Zealand's image as a "friendly government" in the South Pacific.[74]

King Charles III is, severally, the head of state of both the United Kingdom and Solomon Islands. Although the two offices are vested in the same person, he exercises his role as King of Solomon Islands independently of his role as the King of the United Kingdom, consequently, the United Kingdom itself has no jurisdiction in Solomon Islands.[93] Both the United Kingdom and Solomon Islands are members of the Commonwealth of Nations, and participate in events such as the Commonwealth Games.
Bilateral relations with the UK remain strong. The UK's bilateral aid programme in Solomon Islands ended in early 2004 when the UK's regional aid programme came to a close. However, UK funding through the EU, the largest multilateral donor to Solomon Islands, will continue. The UK contributes almost 15% of the EU development budget in Solomon Islands. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office assistance to Solomon Islands is focused on security sector reform, good governance, sustainable development and poverty alleviation. Among the activities supported in the last two years are: education on HIV/AIDS, rural clinics, collective farming and empowerment of women. Sir Nathaniel Waena, the Governor-General of Solomon Islands, visited the UK in 2006 to celebrate the Queen's 80th Birthday. Assistance is also provided through the Commonwealth of Nations, whose budget is supported by the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom is one of only six countries to maintain a resident ambassador in Honiara, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Solomon Islands.[94] The current High Commissioner, since 2016, is David Ward.[95] The British High Commission in Honiara represents British interests in the country and assists British citizens resident in, or visiting the country. The High Commission also funds local projects and assists in scholarships in the United Kingdom for Solomon Islands citizens.
Solomon Islands is represented in the European Commission in Brussels, Belgium, by the Solomon Islands Ambassador, who is also accredited as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.
In October 2008, Solomon Islands prime minister Derek Sikua moved to establish economic relations with Venezuela, hoping to benefit from comparatively cheap Venezuelan oil. In a rare display of bipartisanship, Solomons Opposition leader Manasseh Sogavare praised his political rival for this move, stating that -in the context of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, it would bring down the price of oil for Solomon Islanders, and boost the economy if the Solomons imported crude Venezuelan oil, refined it and then exported it to neighbouring countries.[97]
