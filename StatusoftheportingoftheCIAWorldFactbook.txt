Anyone with a lot of time and a sense of purpose is encouraged to update licence article's with the new data. Please state the World Factbook year to which the country has been updated when updating this list (i.e. "updated to 2007" not "finished").

The Department of State info is at http://www.state.gov/r/pa/bgn/Â ; I'm going about adding that alphabetically, as well; it's taking some time because not all of the text can be cut and pasted directly, at least not without looking sloppy.  Much of it has to be integrated or left unadded, and some of their information, oddly enough, conflicts with the CIA info, esp. in re: economic figures.  The status of that is here
