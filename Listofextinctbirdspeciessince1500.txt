Listofextinctbirdspeciessince1500,

About 129 species of birds have become extinct since 1500,[1] and the rate of extinction seems to be increasing.[2] The situation is exemplified by Hawaii, where 30% of all known recently extinct bird taxa originally lived.[3] Other areas, such as Guam, have also been hit hard; Guam has lost over 60% of its native bird taxa in the last 30 years, many of them due to the introduced brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis).[4]
Currently there are approximately 10,000 living species of birds, with over 1,480 at risk of extinction and 223 critically endangered.[5]
Island species in general, and flightless island species in particular, are most at risk. The disproportionate number of rails in this list reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists; these taxa are listed in List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species.
The extinction dates given below are usually approximations of the actual date of extinction. In some cases, more exact dates are given as it is sometimes possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day (the San Benedicto rock wren is possibly the most extreme example – its extinction could be timed with an accuracy of maybe half an hour). Extinction dates in the literature are usually the dates of the last verified record (credible observation or specimen taken); for many Pacific birds that became extinct shortly after European contact, however, this leaves an uncertainty period of over 100 years, because the islands on which they lived were only rarely visited by scientists.

The extinction of subspecies is a subject very dependent on guesswork. National and international conservation projects and research publications such as red lists usually focus on species as a whole. Reliable information on the status of vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered subspecies usually has to be assembled piecemeal from published observations, such as regional checklists. Therefore, the following listing contains a high proportion of bird taxa that may still exist, but are listed here due to any one of, or any combination of, these three factors: absence of recent records, a known threat such as habitat destruction, or an observed decline.
