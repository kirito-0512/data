Réunion possesses a network of highways, which cover a total distance of 2,784 km.  Of that length, 2,187 km of the road system is paved.  There are no roads going into the cirque of Mafate; thus transportation there has to take place by foot or helicopter.
A system of highways that run between the main cities has been developed.
There are two major ports in Réunion: Le Port and Pointe des Galets.  There are six marinas.  Réunion possesses a merchant marine of one ship with a weight exceeding 1,000 gt, which is a chemical tanker.
There are two airports on the island, of which both have paved runways.  The main airport is the international Roland Garros Airport located close to Saint-Denis and the second one is the Aéroport de Pierrefond, located near Saint-Pierre in the south of the island.
There are no railways in Réunion, with the exception of a short tourist line, which was originally part of a larger rail network. A 42 km light rail project was cancelled in 2010, after a regional government change in 2010, mostly because the project was considered too expensive (€1.6 billion). The region's new president chose to fund a new coastal road instead.[1] In 2019 a new light rail system was proposed to link Le Barachois with the airport.[2]
Due to huge traffic congestion, channelled by the rough topography on the main coastal road, public authorities invested in a cable car transportation system, linking two districts of Saint-Denis : Le Chaudron to Bois de Nèfles, with three intermediate stops.[3] Built by POMA, a leading French company in cable car systems,[4] it opened in March 2022. With 46 cabins, it is designed to transport up to 1200 persons per hour. This cable car is the first in the whole Indian Ocean.
