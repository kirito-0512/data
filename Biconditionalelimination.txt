Biconditionalelimination,
Biconditional elimination is the name of two valid rules of inference of propositional logic. It allows for one to infer a conditional from a biconditional. If 
P
↔
Q
{\displaystyle P\leftrightarrow Q}
 is true, then one may infer that 
P
→
Q
{\displaystyle P\to Q}
 is true, and also that 
Q
→
P
{\displaystyle Q\to P}
 is true.[1] For example, if it's true that I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive, then it's true that if I'm breathing, I'm alive; likewise, it's true that if I'm alive, I'm breathing. The rules can be stated formally as:
and
where the rule is that wherever an instance of "
P
↔
Q
{\displaystyle P\leftrightarrow Q}
" appears on a line of a proof, either "
P
→
Q
{\displaystyle P\to Q}
" or "
Q
→
P
{\displaystyle Q\to P}
" can be placed on a subsequent line;
The biconditional elimination rule may be written in sequent notation:
and
where 
⊢
{\displaystyle \vdash }
 is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
P
→
Q
{\displaystyle P\to Q}
, in the first case, and 
Q
→
P
{\displaystyle Q\to P}
 in the other are syntactic consequences of 
P
↔
Q
{\displaystyle P\leftrightarrow Q}
 in some logical system;
or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:
where 
P
{\displaystyle P}
, and 
Q
{\displaystyle Q}
 are propositions expressed in some formal system.
