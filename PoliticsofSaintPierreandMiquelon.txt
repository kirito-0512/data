PoliticsofSaintPierreandMiquelon,
The politics of Saint Pierre and Miquelon take place in the framework of a parliamentary representative democratic French overseas collectivity, whereby the President of the Territorial Council is the head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government.
The head of state is the President of France, currently Emmanuel Macron. The President is represented in the collectivity by the Prefect of Saint Pierre & Miquelon (French: Préfet) a position currently held by Christian Pouget.[1] The role of the prefect is equivalent to the role of a governor or governor general in English speaking territories.
The Territorial Council of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon (French: Conseil territorial de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon), which was known until February 22, 2007, as the General Council (Conseil général), has 19 members, elected for a three-year term in single seat constituencies. The council sits at the Territorial Council Building, a two-storey, two tone aqua colour building on St. Pierre.

In 1992, a maritime boundary dispute with Canada over the delineation of the Exclusive Economic Zone belonging to France was settled by the International Court of Arbitration.  In the decision, France kept the 12 nautical mile (NM) (22.2 km) territorial sea surrounding the islands and was given an additional 12 NM (22.2 km) contiguous zone as well as a 10.5 NM (19.4 km) wide corridor stretching 200 NM (370 km) south.  The total area in the award was 18% of what France had requested.
The boundary dispute had been a flash point for Franco-Canadian relations. New claims made under UNCLOS by France over the continental shelf might cause new tensions between France and Canada.
