Romania does not recognize the independence of the Republic of Kosovo and considers its territory part of Serbia as the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.[citation needed] As a member of the European Union, Romania considers Kosovo a United Nations protectorate, administered by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo as established by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 UN mission assisted by the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo.
Even if Romania does not consider Kosovo a state, Romanian authorities recognize Kosovo passport and ID as identification documents, but not as travel documents. To travel into Romania, Kosovar citizens holding a Kosovar passport will get from the Romanian authorities a special visa on a separate document that must be shown, when entering Romania, as attached to the Kosovar passport. Therefore, Romanian authorities admit Kosovar citizens on visit without recognizing the legal status of their documents.[citation needed]

Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Serbia were de facto the first states to recognize each other's diplomatic networks – already by the end of 1830s, as both monarchies strived for formal independence from the Ottoman Empire.[19][20] Following their recognition as independent states, on 14/26 April 1879 the Romanian diplomatic agency in Belgrade became a legation, having Lascăr Catargiu as its first resident minister.[21] This status later evolved into full-fledged embassies with assumed more diplomatic and consular affairs, which was ongoing in parallel with the changes of Serbian political status (within Yugoslav kingdom and republic and Serbo-Montenengrin Union state). Nowadays Romania has an embassy in Belgrade, a general consulate in Vršac. Serbia has an embassy in Bucharest, a general consulate in Timișoara. Significant minorities exist on both sides of the border, which are quite exemplary integrated into local societies.
