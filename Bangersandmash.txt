Bangersandmash,
Bangers and mash, also known as sausages and mash, is a traditional British dish consisting of sausages and mashed potato. It may consist of one of a variety of flavoured sausages made of pork, lamb, or beef. The dish is usually served with onion gravy, but may also include fried onions and peas.[1][2][3]
This dish, even when cooked at home, may be thought of as an example of pub grub, meaning it is relatively quick and easy to make in large quantities.[4]
In 2009, the dish was listed as Britain's most popular comfort food in a survey commissioned by TV channel Good Food.[5]
Although it is sometimes stated that the term "bangers" has its origins in World War II, the term was actually in use at least as far back as 1919.[6] The term "bangers" is attributed (in common usage in the UK) to the fact that sausages made during World War I, when there were meat shortages, were made with such a high water content that they were liable to pop under high heat when cooked.[4]
