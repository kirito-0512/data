Charles McCarry (June 14, 1930 – February 26, 2019)[2] was an American writer, primarily of spy fiction, and a former undercover operative for the Central Intelligence Agency.[3]
McCarry's family came from The Berkshires area of western Massachusetts. He was born in Pittsfield, and lived in Virginia.[2][4] He graduated from Dalton High School.[5]
McCarry began his writing career in the United States Army as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes. He served from 1948 to 1951 and achieved the rank of sergeant.[5] He received initial training at Fort Benning, Georgia, and was stationed in Germany for almost two years and at Camp Pickett, Virginia for about a year.[5]
After his army service, he was a speechwriter in the early Administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.[6] In 1958, at the invitation of Cord Meyer,[7] he accepted a post with the CIA, for whom he traveled the globe as a deep cover operative.[8] He took a leave of absence to work for the 1960 Nixon campaign, writing for vice-presidential candidate Henry Cabot Lodge.[3][9] He left the CIA for the last time in 1967, becoming a writer of spy novels.[10][11]
McCarry was also an editor-at-large for National Geographic and contributed pieces to The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, the Saturday Evening Post, and other national publications.[2]
McCarry believed that "the best novels are about ordinary things: love, betrayal, death, trust, loneliness, marriage, fatherhood."[12] In 1988 McCarry described the themes of his novels to date as "ordinary things – love, death, betrayal and the American dream."[13]
McCarry wrote that: "After I resigned [from the CIA], intending to spend the rest of my life writing fiction and knowing what tricks the mind can play when the gates are thrown wide open, as they are by the act of writing, between the imagination and that part of the brain in which information is stored, I took the precaution of writing a closely remembered narrative of my clandestine experiences. After correcting the manuscript, I burned it. What I kept for my own use was the atmosphere of secret life: How it worked on the five senses and what it did to the heart and mind. All the rest went up in flames, setting me free henceforth to make it all up. In all important matters, such as the creation of characters and the invention of plots, with rare and minor exceptions, that is what I have done. And, as might be expected, when I have been weak enough to use something that really happened as an episode in a novel, it is that piece of scrap, buried in a landfill of the imaginary, readers invariably refuse to believe."[14]
McCarry was an admirer of the work of Eric Ambler[2] and W. Somerset Maugham, especially the latter's Ashenden stories. He was also an admirer of Richard Condon, author of The Manchurian Candidate (1959).[4]
Ten of McCarry's novels involve the life story of a fictional character named Paul Christopher, who grew up in pre-Nazi Germany, and later served in the Marines and became an operative for a U.S. government entity known as "the Outfit", meant to represent the Central Intelligence Agency.

Alternately, in chronological order of events depicted:
The Wall Street Journal described McCarry in 2013 as "the dean of American spy writers".[15] The New Republic magazine called him "poet laureate of the CIA";[16] and Otto Penzler described him as "the greatest espionage writer that America has ever produced."[3] Jonathan Yardley, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for the Washington Post, calls him a "'serious' novelist" whose work may include "the best novel ever written about life in high-stakes Washington, D.C."[17] In 2004 P. J. O'Rourke called him "the best modern writer on the subject of intrigue."[18]
The film Wrong is Right (1982), starring Sean Connery, was loosely based on McCarry's novel, The Better Angels (1979).[19][20]
