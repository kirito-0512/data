Breidablik,
Breiðablik (sometimes anglicised as Breithablik or Breidablik) is the home of Baldr in Nordic mythology.
The word Breiðablik has been variously translated as 'broad sheen', 'Broad gleam', 'Broad-gleaming' or 'the far-shining one', [1][2][3][4]
The Eddic poem Grímnismál describes Breiðablik as the fair home of Baldr:
In Snorri Sturluson's Gylfaginning, Breiðablik is described in a list of places in heaven, identified by some scholars as Asgard:[7]
Þar er einn sá staðr, er Breiðablik er kallaðr, ok engi er þar fegri staðr.
Then there is also in that place the abode called Breidablik, and there is not in heaven a fairer dwelling.
Later in the work, when Snorri describes Baldr, he gives another description, citing Grímnismál, though he does not name the poem:
Hann býr þar, sem heitir Breiðablik. Þat er á himni. Í þeim stað má ekki vera óhreint...
The name of Breiðablik has been noted to link with Baldr's attributes of light and beauty.[1]
Similarities have been drawn between the description of Breiðablik in Grímnismál and Heorot in Beowulf, which are both free of 'baleful runes' (Old Norse: feicnstafi and Old English: fācenstafas respectively). In Beowulf, the lack of fācenstafas refers to the absence of crimes being committed, and therefore both halls have been proposed to be sanctuaries.[12]
