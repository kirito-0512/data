HistoryofChristianity,

The history of Christianity concerns the Christian religion, Christian countries, and the Christians with their various denominations, from the 1st century to the present. Christianity originated with the ministry of Jesus, a Jewish teacher and healer who proclaimed the imminent Kingdom of God and was crucified c. AD 30–33 in Jerusalem in the Roman province of Judea.[1] His followers believe that, according to the Gospels, he was the Son of God and that he died for the forgiveness of sins and was raised from the dead and exalted by God, and will return soon at the inception of God's kingdom.[1]
The earliest followers of Jesus were apocalyptic Jewish Christians.[1] Christianity remained a Jewish sect for centuries, diverging gradually from Judaism over doctrinal, social and historical differences.[2] Christianity spread as a grassroots movement that became established by the third century.[3][4][5][6] Sociological studies indicate critical mass was achieved in the hundred years between 150 and 250 which saw Christianity move from fewer than 50,000 adherents to over a million.[7] In 313, the Roman Emperor Constantine I issued the Edict of Milan expressing tolerance for all religions thereby legalizing Christian worship.[8] Under Constantine and his sons, certain pagan rites, including animal sacrifice and divination, began being deprived of their previous position in Roman civilization.[9][10] Other pagan practices were tolerated, and Constantine did not stop the established state support of the traditional religious institutions, nor did society substantially change its predominantly pagan nature under his rule.[11]
Constantine's policies were largely continued by his sons though not universally or continuously.[12] Historian Peter Brown has written that, "it would be profoundly misleading" to claim that the cultural and social changes that took place in Late Antiquity reflected "in any way" that the empire had become "Christianized".[13] Brown asserts "it is impossible to speak of a Christian empire as existing before Justinian 1" in the sixth century. [14]
Various Christological debates about the human and divine nature of Jesus consumed the Christian Church for three centuries, and seven ecumenical councils were called to resolve these debates.[15] Arianism was condemned at the First Council of Nicea (325), which supported the Trinitarian doctrine as expounded in the Nicene Creed.[15]
In the Early Middle Ages, missionary activities spread Christianity towards the west and the north among Germanic peoples;[16] towards the east among Armenians, Georgians, and Slavic peoples;[17] in the Middle East among Syrians and Egyptians;[18] in Eastern Africa among the Ethiopians;[19] and further into Central Asia, China, and India.[20] Christianity played a prominent role in the development of Western civilization, particularly in Europe from late antiquity and the Middle Ages.[21][22]
During the High Middle Ages, Eastern and Western Christianity grew apart, leading to the East–West Schism of 1054. Growing criticism of the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical structure and its corruption in the Late Middle Ages (from the 14th to 15th centuries) led to the Protestant Reformation and its related reform movements, which concluded with the European wars of religion. Since the Renaissance era, with the European colonization of the Americas and other continents that was both supported and opposed by the Christian churches,[23][24][25][26][27] Christianity has expanded throughout the world.[28] Today, there are more than two billion Christians worldwide[29] and Christianity has become the world's largest religion.[30] Within the last century, as the influence of Christianity has progressively waned in the Western world, Christianity continues to be the predominant religion in Europe (including Russia) and the Americas, and has rapidly grown in Asia as well as in the Global South and Third World countries, most notably in Latin America, China, South Korea, and much of Sub-Saharan Africa.[31][32][33][34]
Christianity originated in 1st-century Judea from a sect of apocalyptic Jewish Christians within Second Temple Judaism.[1][35][36][37][38] The basic tenets of the Jewish religion during this era were ethical monotheism and the Torah, or the Mosaic Law.[39] In this period, the Second Temple of Jerusalem was still central to Judaism, but synagogues were also established as institutions for prayer and the reading of Jewish sacred texts.[40] The Hebrew Bible developed during the Second Temple Period, as the Jews decided which religious texts were of divine origin; the Masoretic Text, compiled by the Jewish scribes and scholars of the Early Middle Ages, comprises the Hebrew and Aramaic 24 books that they considered authoritative.[41] Early 1st-century Christians primarily referenced the Septuagint version of the Hebrew Scriptures as it is written in Greek.[40]
The religious, social, and political climate of 1st-century Roman Judea and its neighbouring provinces was extremely diverse and constantly characterized by socio-political turmoil,[1][42][43] with numerous Judaic movements that were both religious and political.[44] The ancient Roman–Jewish historian Flavius Josephus described the four most prominent sects within Second Temple Judaism: Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, and an unnamed "fourth philosophy",[45] which modern historians recognize to be the Zealots and Sicarii.[46]
The 1st century BC and 1st century AD had numerous charismatic religious leaders contributing to what would become the Mishnah of Rabbinic Judaism, including the Jewish sages Yohanan ben Zakkai and Hanina ben Dosa. Jewish messianism, and the Jewish Messiah concept, has its roots in the apocalyptic literature produced between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century BC,[47] promising a future "anointed" leader (messiah or king) from the Davidic line to resurrect the Israelite Kingdom of God, in place of the foreign rulers of the time.[1]
The main sources of information regarding Jesus' life and teachings are the four canonical gospels, and to a lesser extent the Acts of the Apostles and the Pauline epistles. Virtually all scholars of antiquity accept that Jesus was a historical figure.[48] Toward the end of the Twentieth century, multiple scholars traced elements of Christianity to currents in first-century Judaism and discarded nineteenth-century views that Jesus was based on previous pagan deities.[49] Mentions of Jesus in extra-biblical texts exist and are supported as genuine by the majority of historians.[50] Differences between the content of the Jewish Messianic prophecies and the life of Jesus undermine the idea that Jesus was invented as a Jewish Midrash or Peshar.[51]: 344–351 
An approximate chronology of Jesus can be estimated from non-Christian sources, and confirmed by correlating them with New Testament accounts.[52][53] Jesus was most likely born between 7 and 2 BC and died 30–36 AD.[52][54] The baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist can be dated approximately from Josephus' references (Antiquities 18.5.2) to a date before AD 28–35.[55][56][57][58]
Amy-Jill Levine says "there is a consensus of sorts on the basic outline of Jesus' life. Most scholars agree that Jesus was baptized by John, debated with fellow Jews on how best to live according to God’s will, engaged in healings and exorcisms, taught in parables, gathered male and female followers in Galilee, went to Jerusalem, and was crucified by Roman soldiers during the governorship of Pontius Pilate (26–36 CE)."[59]
According to the Gospels, Jesus is the Son of God, who was crucified c. AD 30–33 in Jerusalem.[1] His followers believed that he was raised from the dead and exalted by God, heralding the coming Kingdom of God.[1]

Early Christianity is generally reckoned by church historians to begin with the ministry of Jesus (c. 27–30) and end with the First Council of Nicaea (325). It is typically divided into two periods: the Apostolic Age (c. 30–100, when the first apostles were still alive) and the Ante-Nicene Period (c. 100–325).[60]
The Apostolic Age is named after the Apostles and their missionary activities. It holds special significance in Christian tradition as the age of the direct apostles of Jesus. A primary source for the Apostolic Age is the Acts of the Apostles, but its historical accuracy has been debated and its coverage is partial, focusing especially from Acts 15[61] onwards on the ministry of Paul, and ending around 62 AD with Paul preaching in Rome under house arrest.
The earliest followers of Jesus were a sect of apocalyptic Jewish Christians within Second Temple Judaism.[1][63][64][65][66] While there is evidence supporting the presence of Gentiles even in the earliest Christian communities (Acts 10), most early Christians, such as the Ebionites, were still actively Jewish.[63] The early Christian community in Jerusalem, led by James the Just, brother of Jesus, was singularly influential.[67][68] According to Acts 9,[69] they described themselves as "disciples of the Lord" and [followers] "of the Way", and according to Acts 11,[70] a settled community of disciples at Antioch were the first to be called "Christians". 
The inclusion of Gentiles posed a problem, as they could not fully observe the Halakha. Saul of Tarsus, commonly known as Paul the Apostle, persecuted the early Jewish Christians, then converted and started his mission among the Gentiles.[71] The main concern of Paul's letters is the inclusion of Gentiles into God's New Covenant, sending the message that faith in Christ is sufficient for salvation.[71][72][73]
Jerusalem fell and the Temple was destroyed in 70 AD.[74] This is one of several reasons Christianity gradually grew apart from Judaism, along with other issues: the majority of Jews did not see Jesus as Messiah, Christianity did not support the Jews in their rebellion against Rome, and Christianity blamed Judaism's rejection of Jesus as the reason for the Temple's destruction.[71][2] The fourth-century church fathers Eusebius and Epiphanius of Salamis cite a tradition that, before the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 the Jerusalem Christians had been warned to flee to the mountains in the north (Mark 13:14), but instead they went to Pella in the East in the region of the Decapolis across the Jordan River, although the historicity of Christians in this location is also heavily debated.[75]
The Gospels and New Testament epistles contain remnants of orality in early creeds and hymns, as well as accounts of the Passion, the empty tomb, and Resurrection appearances.[77] Early Christianity spread to pockets of believers among Aramaic-speaking peoples along the Mediterranean coast and also to the inland parts of the Roman Empire and beyond, into the Parthian Empire and the later Sasanian Empire, including Mesopotamia, which was dominated at different times and to varying extent by these empires.[78]
The ante-Nicene period (literally meaning "before Nicaea") was the period following the Apostolic Age down to the First Council of Nicaea in 325. During this period, Christianity was mostly seen as odd, but also as disruptive, and by some, as a threat to "Romanness".[79] Christians criticized fundamental beliefs of Roman society, and refused to participate in rituals, festivals and the imperial cult.[79][80][81] They were a target for suspicion and rumor, including rumors that they were politically subversive and practiced black magic, incest and cannibalism.[82][83] Christianity was mostly tolerated, but also persecuted though persecution tended to be localized actions by mobs and governors until Christianity reached a critical juncture in the mid-third century.[84]
Beginning with less than 1000 people, by the year 100, Christianity had grown to perhaps one hundred small household churches consisting of an average of around seventy (12–200) members each.[85] It achieved critical mass in the hundred years between 150 and 250 when it moved from fewer than 50,000 adherents to over a million.[7] This provided enough adopters for it to be self-sustaining and create further growth.[7][86]
Rodney Stark estimates that Christians made up around 1.9% of the Roman population in 250.[87] That year, Decius made it a capital offence to refuse to make sacrifices to Roman Gods. The majority of scholars see Decius' decree as a  requirement applied to all the inhabitants of the Empire, but they also see it as possible he intended it as an anti-Christian measure. Demanding that a 'suspected' Christian participate in a sacrifice had been a standard way of determining whether someone was truly a Christian since Pliny the Younger. As J. B. Rives has written, "An emperor who required universal sacrifice in the mid- third century A.D. could hardly be oblivious of its implications for Christians, while the fact that Decius himself presided over the trial of a Christian recalcitrant early on in the edict's implementation suggests a particular interest in them".[88]
Still, Decius did not outlaw Christian worship and may not have targeted Christians specifically.[89] Valerian pursued similar policies later that decade. These were followed by a 40-year period of tolerance known as the "little peace of the Church". Scholars generally agree there was a significant rise in the absolute number of Christians in the third century.[90] Stark, building on earlier estimates by theologian Robert M. Grant and historian Ramsay MacMullen, estimates that Christians made up around ten percent of the Roman population by 300.[87] The last and most severe official persecution, the Diocletianic Persecution, took place in 303–311.[81]
By the beginning of the Nicene period, the Christian faith had spread throughout Western Europe and the Mediterranean Basin, and to North Africa and the East. A more formal Church structure grew out of the early communities, and various Christian doctrines developed. 
In the post-Apostolic church a hierarchy of clergy gradually emerged as overseers of urban Christian populations took on the form of episkopoi (overseers, the origin of the terms bishop and episcopal) and presbyters (elders; the origin of the term priest) and then deacons (servants). But this emerged slowly and at different times in different locations. Clement, a 1st-century bishop of Rome, refers to the leaders of the Corinthian church in his epistle to Corinthians as bishops and presbyters interchangeably. The New Testament writers also use the terms overseer and elders interchangeably and as synonyms.[91]
As the church grew, it organized itself following the pattern of the Empire. Originally, the term known in the Roman East as a diœcesis (Gr.) was used in Roman law to designate a territory dependent upon a city for administration. Diocletian then used the term to name the twelve geographical provinces of the empire, setting over each a vicarius (a vicar) under the authority of the praetorian prefect.[92] The territory administered by a bishop was the same as those juridical territories, and came to be known within the church by its ordinary civil term: diocese. The bishop's actual physical location within his diocese was his "seat", or "see".[93]
A study by Edwin A. Judge, social scientist, shows that a fully organized church system existed before Constantine and the Council of Nicea.[4]
Walter Bauer wrote, (in his seminal work Rechtgläubigkeit und Ketzerei im ältesten Christentum, a classic in its field  first published in 1934), that Christianity of the second and third centuries was highly diverse; that its heretical forms were early, widespread, and strong; and that orthodoxy came later when the Roman church enforced conformity to its views.[94] Contemporary support for Bauer's Thesis includes the well known author Bart Ehrman, and in popular American culture, the Bauer-Ehrman thesis is the prevailing paradigm.[95][96][97]
Paul Hartog writes that this continues to be a "live" topic amongst scholars.[98] Scholars agree there was a variety of belief in the second and third centuries, and that orthodoxy did not precede heresy in every region. Arian missionaries were the first to enter some German tribes and Eastern European regions.[99] However, unambiguous evidence in Ephesus and western Asia Minor has demonstrated that heresy in these regions was neither early nor strong, that it was preceded by orthodoxy, and that orthodoxy was numerically larger.[100] Another problem with the Bauer-Ehrman thesis is that in the early centuries, a powerful, united, Roman church capable of enforcing its will did not exist.[101][102]
Post-Bauer scholarship, discoveries and insights have found diversity but also unity and normativity.[103] The earliest writers shared 'core beliefs' on doctrine, ethos, fellowship and community.[104] Doctrinal tenets included monotheism, Jesus as Christ and Lord, and the Gospel as a message concerning salvation.[105] Andreas J. Köstenberger and Michael J. Kruger advocate that "the earliest normative Christianity centered on Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection for the forgiveness of sin. This ...serves as a benchmark..."[105] Early devotion to Jesus is reflected in the alteration of traditional Jewish theology and in the theological continuity of early writers.[101]
The Septuagint, or the LXX Version, is a translation of the Hebrew scriptures, and some related texts, into Koine Greek. Begun in Alexandria in the late 3rd century BCE and completed by 132 BCE, it was influential in Early Christianity which used it as its primary text.[106][40] During the rise of Christianity in the first century CE, new scriptures were written in Koine Greek. Christians eventually called these new scriptures the "New Testament", and began referring to the Septuagint as the "Old Testament".[107] The New Testament has been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work.[108][109] Most early Christian copyists were not trained scribes.[110] Early Christians transported these writings around the Empire, translating them into Old Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, Latin, and other languages.[111]
The letters of the Apostle Paul sent to the early Christian communities in Rome, Greece, and Asia Minor were circulating in collected form by the end of the 1st century.[113] New Testament books already had considerable authority in the late first and early second centuries.[114] Even in its formative period, most of the books of the NT that were seen as scripture were already agreed upon. Linguistics scholar Stanley E. Porter says "evidence from the apocryphal non-Gospel literature is the same as that for the apocryphal Gospels – in other words, that the text of [most of] the Greek New Testament was relatively well established and fixed by the time of the second and third centuries".[115] By the early 3rd century, there existed a set of early Christian writings similar to the current New Testament.[116]
There were disputes over the canonicity of some texts such as the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Epistle of James, the First and Second Epistle of Peter, the First Epistle of John, and the Book of Revelation.[117][118] By the 4th century, there existed unanimity in the Latin Church concerning the canonical texts included in the New Testament canon,[119] and by the 5th century the Eastern Churches, with a few exceptions, had come to accept the Book of Revelation and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the canon.[120]
The list of books included in the Catholic Bible was established as canon by the Council of Rome in 382, followed by those of Hippo in 393 and Carthage in 397. Between 385 and 405 CE, the early Christian church translated its canon into Vulgar Latin (the common Latin spoken by ordinary people), a translation known as the Vulgate.[121] Since then, Catholic Christians have held ecumenical councils to standardize their biblical canon. The Council of Trent (1545–63), held by the Catholic Church in response to the Protestant Reformation, authorized the Vulgate as its official Latin translation of the Bible.[121]
A number of biblical canons have since evolved. Christian biblical canons range from the 73 books of the Catholic Church canon, and the 66-book canon of most Protestant denominations, to the 81 books of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church canon, among others.[122] Judaism has long accepted a single authoritative text, whereas Christianity has never had an official version, instead having many different manuscript traditions.[123]
As Christianity spread throughout the provinces of the Roman Empire and beyond its borders, it acquired certain members from high-ranking social classes and well-educated circles of the Hellenistic world; they sometimes became bishops who wrote famous sermons and treatises. They were primarily defenders of orthodoxy, but they also wrote philosophy and theology as well as apologetics and polemics.[124]  Historians and theologians refer to this as the "golden age" of Christian thought.[125]: 1 
Figures such as John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Jerome, Basil, Gregory of Nazianus, Gregory of Nyssa, and the prolific Augustine, all wrote major works that are still studied. For example, Augustine on human will became a focus for later philosophers such as Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche.[126] Augustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his Confessions, had a continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern phenomenology and hermeneutics.[127]
Early Christian art and architecture emerged about 200 AD.[128] The oldest known Christian paintings are from the Roman catacombs and the oldest Christian sculptures are from sarcophagi.[129] The early rejection of images, and the necessity to hide Christian practice from persecution, left behind few written records, but art in the catacombs beneath Rome reveals some aspects of early Christianity and its evolution.[129][130]
Reinterpreting Jewish and pagan symbolism, Christianity infused the symbols with its own interpretation.[131] It gave visual expression to their conviction that the human soul can be delivered from death to an everlasting life.[131][130] Judith Anne Testa writes that the difference is that "The Jewish faith puts little emphasis on immortality, and pagan beliefs about the afterlife were vague, uncertain, and sometimes dismal".[132]
While many new subjects appear for the first time in the Christian catacombs – i.e. the Good Shepherd, Baptism, and the Eucharistic meal – the Orant figures (women praying with upraised hands) probably came directly from pagan art.[133][134]: 125 
Jewish and pagan use of sheep and goats, birds in a tree or vine, or eating fruit, especially grapes, seven steps leading up to a tomb, a pair of peacocks, the Robe of sanctity, the reading of scrolls, are all found in pagan art and adapted in Christian art to express the hope of immortality in Christian terms.[135]
Pagan sarcophagi had long carried images of shells, and portraits of the dead often had shells over the head of the dead, while some put a shell over a grave. Christians and Jews adapted the convention, identifying it with another symbol – the halo.[130] For the Christians who made the catacombs, these symbols were necessary to convey their message that could otherwise not be done openly.[136]
Constantine I became the Roman Empire's first Christian emperor, but how much Christianity he adopted at this point is difficult to discern.[137] Brown calls Constantine's conversion a "very Roman conversion."[138] "He had risen to power in a series of deadly civil wars, destroyed the system of divided empire, believed the Christian God had brought him victory, and therefore regarded that god as the proper recipient of religio".[138] Constantine was over 40, had most likely been a traditional polytheist, and according to Brown, was a savvy and ruthless politician when he declared himself a Christian.[139]
Although he was not baptized until shortly before his death, he pursued policies that were favorable to Christianity. He supported the Church financially, built various basilicas, granted to clergy privileges previously available only to pagan priests (e.g., exemption from certain taxes), promoted Christians to some high offices, and returned confiscated property.[140] Constantine played an active role in the leadership of the Church. In 316, he acted as a judge in a North African dispute concerning the Donatist controversy. More significantly, in 325 he summoned the Council of Nicaea, the first ecumenical council.[141] Imperial favor was an important factor in the success of the church over the next century.[142][143]
Contemporary scholars are in general agreement that Constantine did not support the suppression of paganism by force.[144][145] [146][147][note 1] He never engaged in a purge,[168] there were no pagan martyrs during his reign.[167][169] Pagans remained in important positions at his court.[144] Constantine ruled for 31 years and never outlawed paganism.[167][170]
However, Constantine wrote laws that threatened and menaced pagans who continued to practice sacrifice.[9][10] There is no evidence of any of the horrific punishments ever being enacted.[171] There is no record of anyone being executed for violating religious laws before Tiberius II Constantine at the end of the sixth century (574–582).[172] Still, classicist Scott Bradbury notes that the complete disappearance of public sacrifice by the mid-fourth century "in many towns and cities must be attributed to the atmosphere created by imperial and episcopal hostility".[173] Other pagan practices were tolerated. Constantine did not stop the established state support of the traditional religious institutions, nor did society substantially change its pagan nature under his rule.[11]
According to Stark, the rate of Christianity's growth under its first Christian emperor in the 4th century did not alter (more than normal regional fluctuations) from its rate of growth in the first three centuries. However, since Stark describes an exponential growth curve, he adds that this "probably was a period of 'miraculous seeming' growth in terms of absolute numbers".[174] Constantine's policies were largely continued by his sons though not universally or continuously.[12] By the middle of the fourth century, it is likely that Christians comprised somewhere around half of the empire's population.[87]
Over the century after Constantine, his nephew Julian became the only non-Christian emperor. Under the influence of his adviser Mardonius, Julian renounced Christianity and embraced a Neoplatonic and mystical form of Greco-Roman Paganism.[175] He campaigned against corruption, instituted several reforms and rebuilding projects, but is best known for attempting to revive Greco-Roman Paganism in the Roman Empire. He began by reopening the temples his predecessor Constantius had closed,[176]  modifying them to resemble episcopal structures, by advocating public charity (previously unknown in the Greco-Roman religion), and by personally practicing sacrifice. There was little public support, and Julian's short reign ended when he was wounded in the Battle of Samarra and died days later during the expedition against the Sasanian Empire (363).[177]
Still, paganism had not completely ended, though it had been gradually declining in popularity since the second century BC.[178][179] Paganism persisted despite the absence of the ritual of sacrifice, writes Brown, because  polytheists were accustomed to offering prayers to the gods in many ways and places that did not include sacrifice. Pollution was only associated with sacrifice, and the ban on sacrifice had fixed boundaries and limits.[180] Paganism thus remained widespread into the early fifth century continuing in parts of the empire into the seventh and beyond.[181]
During Antiquity, the Eastern church produced multiple doctrinal controversies that attempted to define how, and when, the Christ became both human and divine.[182] These were often dubbed heresies by their opponents, and during this age, the first ecumenical councils were convened to deal with them. 
One of the earliest and most popular of the  nontrinitarian Christological doctrines was Arianism. It spread throughout most of the Roman Empire from the 4th century onwards.[183][184] It was founded by the Christian presbyter Arius from Alexandria, Egypt. Arius upheld the traditional belief in Christ's Divinity, but argued that Jesus was God's first divine creation, therefore, Christ is not co-eternal with Him but is instead subordinate to God the Father.[183][184] The First Council of Nicaea (325) and the First Council of Constantinople (381) resulted in a condemnation of Arian teachings as heresy and produced the Nicene Creed. Arianism was eventually eliminated by orthodox opposition and empirical law, though it remained popular for some time.[183][184]
Following the death of the archbishop of Constantinople Sisinnius, the monk Nestorius became his successor on 10 April 428.[185]  Nestorius took measures opposing heresy and influenced the emperor Theodosius II (408– 450) to issue anti-heretical legislation. This alienated the monks in his diocese.[185] Those monks brought to Nestorius a disagreement they were having with another group over the use of the title ‘Mother of God' for Mary.[186] Nestorius' response produced a view of Jesus as having had two distinct natures, one fully divine and one fully human. On the Byzantine side, Christ had only one nature with both qualities, while Monophysitism claimed Jesus had one divine nature, not a truly human one.[187][188] Thereafter, the question became heavily and bitterly debated.[187]
The Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth ecumenical councils are generally considered the most important, and all are characterized by Nestorianism vs. Monophysitism.[189] The West came down firmly on the side of stressing the humanity of Christ and the reality of His moral choices. To preserve His Divine nature, the unity of His person was described in a looser way than in Eastern theology. It was primarily this difference which was at the heart of the Nestorian controversy.[190]
The resulting schism created a communion of churches, including the Armenian, Syrian, and Egyptian churches.[191] By the end of the 5th century, the Persian Church had become independent of the Roman Church eventually evolving into the modern Church of the East.[192] Though efforts were made at reconciliation in the next few centuries, the schism remained permanent, resulting in what is today known as Oriental Orthodoxy.  Most Christians in Asia belonged to branches of the Nestorian church from the end of the fifth century into the thirteenth century.[193]
According to Anna Sapir Abulafia, most scholars agree that Jews and Christians in Latin Christendom lived in relative peace with one another until the thirteenth century.[194]: xii [195]: 3  Scattered violence toward Jews occasionally took place during riots led by mobs, local leaders, and lower level clergy without the support of church leaders.[196]: 1–17  Jeremy Cohen says historians generally agree this is because Catholic thought on the Jews among the leaders of the church was guided by the teachings of Augustine who rejected those who argued that the Jews should be killed, or forcibly converted, and argued for their immunity.[197]: 78–80 
Sometime before the fifth century, though exactly when is debated, the church took its universally held traditional interpretation of Revelation 20:4-6 (Millennialism), and augmented it with supersessionism.[198]: 133 [199]: 27  Millennialism is the hope of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah on earth, centered in Jerusalem, ruling with the redeemed Israel.[198]: 3  Supersessionism is a historicized and allegorized version of this which sees the church as the metaphorical Israel, thereby eliminating the Jews altogether.[198]: xi, 12 
Supersessionism is significant because "It is undeniable that anti-Jewish bias has often gone hand-in-hand with the supersessionist view."[199]: 5, 6  Many Jewish writers trace anti-semitism, and the consequences of it in World War II, to this particular doctrine among Christians.[200]: 169 [201]: 8, 9 
Supersessionism was considered a "normative view" in the writings of the early church fathers, such as Justin, Barnabas and Origen, and has been a part of Christian thought for much of Christian history.[198]: 5, 25  However, supersessionism has never been an official doctrine and has never been universally held.[198]: 3   The traditional view was the more universally held view of the first two centuries, and has remained the predominant view throughout history.[198]: 3 
In the centuries following his death, Theodosius I (347–395) gained a reputation as the emperor who established Nicene Christianity as the official religion of the empire. Modern historians no longer see this as actual history, but instead, see it as a later interpretation of history by Christian writers.[202] 
Theodosius' predecessors had been semi-Arians, while Theodosius was orthodox, so the orthodox Christian literary tradition gave Theodosius credit for the "triumph" of Christianity.[203][204][205][note 2] Nearly all sources on Theodosius are ecclesiastical histories that are highly colored and carefully curated for public reading.[202][14] This is problematic according to historian Peter Brown, as "it is impossible to speak of a Christian empire as existing before Justinian in the sixth century".[14]
Some previous scholars interpreted the Edict of Thessalonica (380) as establishing Christianity as the state religion.[212] However, most twenty-first century scholars see the Edict as addressed to Christians in the Eastern Empire, not Jews or pagans, with the purpose of opposing Arianism.[213][note 3]
The law of 8 November 392 has also been described as a universal ban on paganism that would, in effect, have made Christianity the official religion of the empire without actually saying so.[218][219] The law was addressed only to Rufinus in the East, it makes no mention of Christianity, and it focuses only on practices of private domestic sacrifice: the lares, the penates and the genius.[220][221][note 4] Sozomen, the Constantinopolitan lawyer, wrote a history of the church around 443 where he evaluates the law of 8 November 392 as having had only minor significance at the time it was issued.[227]
Although Theodosius wrote multiple laws against heresy and sacrifice from the beginning of his reign till its end, sources do not support the view that Theodosius created an environment of intolerance and persecution of pagans.[213][228][229][note 5] In his 2020 biography of Theodosius, Mark Hebblewhite concludes that Theodosius never saw himself, or advertised himself, as a destroyer of the old cults.[239][240]
Earliest references to the conversion of the Germanic peoples are in the writings of Irenaeus (130–202 ), Origen (185–253), and Tertullian (Adv. Jud. VII) (155–220).[241] Tacitus is also an important early source describing the nature of German religion and their understanding of the function of a king, as facilitating their wholesale conversion with entire tribes converting following the king's conversion.[242][243] In 341, Romanian born Ulfila (Wulfilas, 311–383) spread Arian Christianity among the Goths, firmly establishing the faith. This kept them culturally and religiously distinct from Chalcedonian Christians.[183][184][244]
Most scholars agree that Christianity was officially adopted in AD 313 or AD 315 when Gregory the Illuminator baptized the Albanian king and ordained the first bishop Tovmas, the founder of the Albanian church. It is highly probable that Christianity covered the whole of antique Caucasian Albania by the late fourth century.[245][246]
Informal primacy was exercised by the Archdiocese of Carthage, a metropolitan archdiocese also known as "Church of Carthage". The Church of Carthage thus was to the Early African church what the Church of Rome was to the Catholic Church in Italy.[247] Famous figures include Saint Perpetua, Saint Felicitas, and their Companions (died c. 203), Tertullian (c. 155–240), Cyprian  (c. 200–258), Caecilianus (floruit 311), Saint Aurelius (died 429), Augustine of Hippo (died 430), and Eugenius of Carthage (died 505). Tertullian and Cyprian are both considered Latin Church Fathers of the Latin Church. Tertullian, a theologian of part Berber descent, was instrumental in the development of trinitarian theology, and was the first to apply Latin language extensively in his theological writings. As such, Tertullian has been called "the father of Latin Christianity"[248][249] and "the founder of Western theology."[250] Carthage remained an important center of Christianity, hosting several councils of Carthage.
Donatism was a Christian sect leading to a schism in the Church, in the region of the Church of Carthage, from the fourth to the sixth centuries. Donatists argued that Christian clergy must be faultless for their ministry to be effective and their prayers and sacraments to be valid. Donatism had its roots in the long-established Christian community of the Roman province Africa Proconsularis (present-day Tunisia, Morocco, the northeast of Algeria, and the western coast of Libya), in the persecutions of Christians under Diocletian. Named after the Berber Christian bishop Donatus Magnus, Donatism flourished during the fourth and fifth centuries.[251] Donatism mainly spread among the indigenous Berber population.[252][253]
Monasticism is a form of asceticism whereby one renounces worldly pursuits and goes off alone as a hermit or joins a tightly organized community of the like-minded. Christian monasticism grew from roots in certain strands of Judaism and views in common with Graeco-Roman philosophy and religion, and was modeled upon Scriptural examples and ideals such as John the Baptist who was seen as an archetypical monk.[254][255]  Christian monasticism emerged separately from these other previous forms in the third century; by the 330's, it had become a significant social and religious force, and by the 350's, Egypt had become known throughout the Roman world as the center of that movement.[254] By the fifth century, Christian monasticism was a dominant force in all areas of late antique culture.[256]
[note 6]
Monastic communities were, in general, devoted to prayer, moderate self denial, manual labor and mutual support.[260] However, early monastics also devoted a great deal of thought to sickness, health care and what positive social role the sick, the elderly and the disabled could still play, despite their condition.[261]
The monastic response was a health care system that was innovative in its methods, allowing the sick to remain within the monastery as a special class afforded special benefits and care.[261]  This destigmatized illness and legitimized the deviance from the norm that sickness includes. This formed the basis for future public health care.[262]
According to Albert Jonsen, a historian of medicine, "the second great sweep of medical history [began] at the end of the fourth century, with the founding of the first Christian hospital for the poor at Caesarea in Cappadocia."[263][264][note 7] By the fifth century, the founding of hospitals for the poor had become common for bishops, abbots and abbesses.[267]
Central figures in the development of monasticism were Basil the Great in the East and, in the West, Benedict, who created the Rule of Saint Benedict, which would become the most common rule throughout the Middle Ages and the starting point for other monastic rules.[268]
The transition into the Early Middle Ages was a process that differed based on geographic location. The fall of Rome left a power vacuum that was eventually filled by Byzantium, Islam and the early medieval West.[269]
The stepwise loss of Western Roman Empire dominance, replaced with foederati and Germanic kingdoms, coincided with early missionary efforts into areas no longer controlled by the collapsing empire.[270] In the late fifth century, there had been an immediate decline in the standard of living and a return to agrarian culture and barter. Rural areas rose as power centers while urban areas declined.[271] "What little security there was in this world was provided by the Christian church" says historians Matthews and Platt.[271]
Pope Celestine I (422–430) sent Palladius to be the first bishop to the Irish in 431, and in 432, Gaul supported St Patrick as he began his mission there.[272] Relying largely on recent archaeological developments, Lorcan Harney has reported to the Royal Academy that the missionaries and traders who came to Ireland in the fifth to sixth centuries were not backed by any military force.[272]
Recent archaeology indicates Christianity had become an established minority faith in some parts of Britain by the fourth century. It was largely mainstream, and in certain areas, was continuous.[273] Irish missionaries led by Saint Columba, went to Iona (from 563), and converted many Picts.[274] The court of Anglo-Saxon Northumbria, and the Gregorian mission who landed in 596 sent by Pope Gregory I and led by Augustine of Canterbury, did the same for the Kingdom of Kent.[275]
The Franks first appear in the historical record in the 3rd century as a confederation of Germanic tribes living on the east bank of the lower Rhine River. The largely Christian Gallo-Roman inhabitants of Gaul (modern France and Belgium) were overrun by the Franks in the early 5th century. They were persecuted until the Frankish King Clovis I converted from Paganism to Roman Catholicism in 496.[276] Clovis I became the first king of the Franks to unite all of the Frankish tribes under one ruler.[277]
In 416, the Germanic Visigoths had crossed into Hispania as Roman allies.[278] They converted to Arian Christianity shortly before 429.[279]  An important shift took place in 612 when the Visigothic King Sisebut declared the obligatory conversion of all Jews in Spain, contradicting Pope Gregory who had reiterated the traditional ban against forced conversion of the Jews in 591.[280] Scholars refer to this shift as a "seismic moment" in Christian history.[281]
The Eastern Roman Empire, with its heartland in Greece and Asia Minor, became the Byzantine Empire after the fall of the Roman West.[282] With its autocratic government, stable farm economy, Greek heritage and Orthodox Christianity, the Byzantine Empire lasted until 1453 and the Fall of Constantinople.[182]
During Byzantium's first major historical period, from 476 to 641, its borders reached its furthest limits under the Emperor Justinian I.[283] In an attempt to reunite the empire, Justinian went to Rome to liberate it from barbarians leading to a guerrilla war that lasted nearly 20 years.[284] After fighting ended, Justinian used a Pragmatic Sanction to assert control over Italy.[285]
The Sanction effectively removed the supports that had allowed the Roman Senate to retain power.[286] Thereafter, the political and social influence of the Senate's aristocratic members disappeared, and by 630, the Senate ceased to exist. Its building was converted into a church.[286] Bishops stepped into civic leadership in the Senator's places.[286] The position and influence of the pope rose.[287]
Before the eighth century, the Pope as the 'Bishop of Rome,' had not had special influence over other bishops outside Rome and had not yet manifested as the central ecclesiastical power.[288] From the late seventh to the middle of the eighth century, eleven of the thirteen men who held the position of Roman Pope were the sons of families from the East. Before they could be installed, these Popes had to be approved by the head of State, the Byzantine emperor.[289]
This Byzantine papacy, along with losses to Islam and changes within Christianity itself, helped put an end to Ancient Christianity in the West.[290][291] This helped transform Christianity into its eclectic medieval forms.[292][293][294]
In terms of prosperity and cultural life, the Byzantine Empire of this period forms one of the high points of Christian history and Christian civilization,[295] and Constantinople remained the leading city of the Christian world in size, wealth, and culture.[296] There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy and science, as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek.[297] Byzantine art and literature held a preeminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the West during this period was enormous and of long-lasting significance.[298]
Following a series of heavy military reversals against the Muslims, Iconoclasm emerged within the provinces of the Byzantine Empire in the early 8th century. In the 720s, the Byzantine Emperor Leo III the Isaurian banned the pictorial representation of Christ, saints, and biblical scenes. In the Latin West, Pope Gregory III held two synods at Rome and condemned Leo's actions. The Byzantine Iconoclast Council, held at Hieria in 754 AD, ruled that holy portraits were heretical.[299] The iconoclastic movement destroyed much of the Christian Church's early artistic history. The iconoclastic movement was later defined as heretical in 787 AD under the Second Council of Nicaea (the seventh ecumenical council) but had a brief resurgence between 815 and 842 AD.
The rise of Islam from 600–1517 unleashed a series of military campaigns that conquered Syria, Mesopotamia, Egypt and Persia by 650, adding North Africa and most of Spain by 740.[300] Only the Franks and Constantinople were able to withstand this medieval juggernaut. Islam was the colossus of the Middle Ages. Historians Matthews and Platt wrote that, "At its height, the Arab Empire stretched from the Indus River and the borders of China in the East, to the Atlantic in the West, and from the Taurus mountains in the North to the Sahara in the South".[300] This vast empire was "an autocratically ruled theocracy dependent on the back-breaking labor of an army of peasants".[300]
Since they are considered "People of the Book" in the Islamic religion, Christians under Muslim rule were subjected to the status of dhimmi (along with Jews, Samaritans, Gnostics, Mandeans, and Zoroastrians), which was inferior to the status of Muslims.[301][302] Thus, Christians and other religious minorities faced religious discrimination and persecution. It was forbidden to evangelize or spread Christianity) on pain of death. They were banned from bearing arms, undertaking certain professions, and were obligated to dress differently in order to distinguish themselves from Arabs.[301]
Under the Islamic law (sharīʿa), Non-Muslims were obligated to pay the jizya and kharaj taxes.[301][302] Together with periodic heavy ransom levied upon Christian communities by Muslim rulers (in order to fund military campaigns, all of which contributed a significant proportion of income to the Islamic states), reduced many Christians to poverty. These financial and social hardships forced many Christians to convert to Islam.[301] Christians unable to pay these taxes were forced to surrender their children to the Muslim rulers as payment who would sell them as slaves to Muslim households where they were forced to convert to Islam.[301]
Various Christian communities in the regions of Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Armenia resented the governance of the Western Roman Empire or that of the Byzantine Empire, and preferred to live as dhimmi under the Muslim rulers.[302] However, modern historians also recognize that the Christian populations living in the lands invaded by the Arab Muslim armies between the 7th and 10th centuries AD suffered religious persecution, religious violence, and martyrdom multiple times at the hands of Arab Muslim officials and rulers;[302][303][304][305] many were executed under the Islamic death penalty for defending their Christian faith through dramatic acts of resistance such as refusing to convert to Islam, repudiation of the Islamic religion and subsequent reconversion to Christianity, and blasphemy towards Muslim beliefs.[303][304][305]
According to the Ḥanafī school of Islamic law (sharīʿa), the testimony of a Non-Muslim (such as a Christian or a Jew) was not considered valid against the testimony of a Muslim in legal or civil matters. Historically, in Islamic culture and traditional Islamic law Muslim women have been forbidden from marrying Christian or Jewish men, whereas Muslim men have been permitted to marry Christian or Jewish women[306][307] (see: Interfaith marriage in Islam). Christians under Islamic rule had the right to convert to Islam or any other religion, while conversely a murtad, or an apostate from Islam, faced severe penalties or even hadd, which could include the Islamic death penalty.[303][304][305]
In general, Christians subject to Islamic rule were allowed to practice their religion with some notable limitations stemming from the apocryphal Pact of Umar. This treaty, supposedly enacted in 717 AD, forbade Christians from publicly displaying the cross on church buildings, from summoning congregants to prayer with a bell, from re-building or repairing churches and monasteries after they had been destroyed or damaged, and imposed other restrictions relating to occupations, clothing, and weapons.[308] The Umayyad Caliphate persecuted many Berber Christians in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, who slowly converted to Islam.[309]
The Abbasid Caliphate was less tolerant of Christianity than had been the Umayyad caliphs.[302] When Elias of Heliopolis moved to Damascus from Heliopolis (Ba'albek), he was accused of apostasy after attending a party held by a Muslim Arab, and was forced to flee Damascus for his hometown. He returned eight years later, when he was recognized and imprisoned by the "eparch", probably the jurist al-Layth ibn Sa'd.[311]: 34  After refusing to convert to Islam under torture, he was brought before the Damascene emir and relative of the caliph al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), Muhammad ibn-Ibrahim, who promised good treatment if Elias would convert.[311]: 34  On his repeated refusal, Elias was tortured and beheaded and his body burnt, cut up, and thrown into the river Chrysorrhoes (the Barada) in 779 AD.[311]: 34 
According to the Synaxarion of Constantinople, the hegumenos Michael of Zobe and thirty-six of his monks at the Monastery of Zobe near Sebasteia (Sivas) were killed by a raid on the community.[311]: 70  The perpetrator was the "emir of the Hagarenes", "Alim", probably Ali ibn-Sulayman, an Abbasid governor who raided Roman territory in 785 AD.[311]: 70  Bacchus the Younger was beheaded in Jerusalem in 786–787 AD. Bacchus was Palestinian, whose family, having been Christian, had been converted to Islam by their father.[311]: 29–30  Bacchus however, remained crypto-Christian and undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, upon which he was baptized and entered the monastery of Mar Saba.[311]: 29–30  Reunion with his family prompted their reconversion to Christianity and Bacchus's trial and execution for apostasy under the governing emir Harthama ibn A'yan.[311]: 29–30 
After the 838 Sack of Amorium, the hometown of the emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) and his Amorian dynasty, the caliph al-Mu'tasim (r. 833–842) took more than forty Roman prisoners to the capital, Samarra, where after seven years of theological debates and repeated refusals to convert to Islam, they were put to death in March 845 under the caliph al-Wathiq (r. 842–847).[311]: 41–42  Within a generation they were venerated as the 42 Martyrs of Amorium.[note 8]
During the 10th-century phase of the Arab–Byzantine wars, the victories of the Romans over the Arabs resulted in mob attacks on Christians, who were believed to sympathize with the Roman state.[302] According to Bar Hebraeus, the catholicus of the Church of the East, Abraham III (r. 906–937), wrote to the grand vizier that "we Nestorians are the friends of the Arabs and pray for their victories".[302] The attitude of the Nestorians "who have no other king but the Arabs", he contrasted with the Greek Orthodox Church, whose emperors he said "had never ceased to make war against the Arabs".[302] Between 923 and 924 AD, several Orthodox churches were destroyed in mob violence in Ramla, Ascalon, Caesarea Maritima, and Damascus.[302] In each instance, according to the Arab Melkite Christian chronicler Eutychius of Alexandria, the caliph al-Muqtadir (r. 908–932) contributed to the rebuilding of ecclesiastical property.[302]
Nonetheless, Christian officials continued to be employed in the government, and the Christians of the Church of the East and the Jacobite Church were often tasked with the translation of Ancient Greek philosophy and Greek mathematics.[302][312][note 9] The writings of al-Jahiz attacked Christians for being too prosperous, and indicates they were able to ignore even those restrictions placed on them by the state.[302] In the late 9th century, the patriarch of Jerusalem, Theodosius, wrote to his colleague the patriarch of Constantinople Ignatios that "they are just and do us no wrong nor show us any violence".[302]
Saxon resistance to rule by the Carolingian kings was fierce and often targeted Christian churches and monasteries.[322] In 782 Saxons broke yet another treaty with Charlemagne, attacking the Franks when the king was away, dealing the Frankish troops heavy losses.[276][323][324] In response, the Frankish King returned, defeated them, and "enacted a variety of draconian measures" beginning with the massacre at Verden.[325] He ordered the decapitation of 4500 Saxon prisoners offering them baptism as an alternative to death.[326] These events were followed by the severe legislation of the Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae in 785 which prescribes death to those that are disloyal to the king, harm Christian churches or its ministers, or practice pagan burial rites.[327] His harsh methods raised objections from his friends Alcuin and Paulinus of Aquileia.[328] Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.[329]
Charlemagne also began the Carolingian Renaissance, a period of intellectual and cultural revival of literature, arts, and scriptural studies, a renovation of law and the courts, and the promotion of literacy. Charlemagne himself could not read or write, but he admired it, so in order to address the problems of illiteracy, Charlemagne founded schools and attracted the most learned men from all of Europe to his court. Beginning in the late 8th century under Charlemagne, it continued into the 9th century under his son, Louis the Pious.[330]
The intense and rapid changes which occurred during the High Middle Ages, that are generally considered some of the most significant changes in the history of Christianity, included a "profound revolution in religious sentiment".[331] The church's stated purpose had long been to change the heart of individual persons, not the social order, and ancient Christians had not thought of their movement in terms of social reform.[332] Instead, during the High Middle Ages, new monastic movements created two images of the Benedictine ideal: the traditional contemplative, and those who now saw their calling in terms of actively working to reform the world.[333]
The church of this era had immense authority, but the key to its power were three monastic reformation movements that swept Europe throughout this period.[334][335] Prior to this, the church had become riddled with corruption, the buying and selling of church offices, and disregard for the sacraments.[336]
The monastery at Cluny was established in 910 by the Benedictine Order without feudal obligations, allowing it to institute reforms.[336] Cluny created a large, federated order in which the administrators of subsidiary houses served as deputies of the abbot of Cluny, answering to him as he answered to the Pope, enabling both the requirement of reform and the enforcement of it. The Cluniac spirit was a revitalising influence on the Norman Church, at its height from the second half of the 10th century through the early 12th century.[331] Owing to the stricter adherence to the reformed Benedictine rule, the Abbey of Cluny became the acknowledged leading centre of Western monasticism from the later 10th century.[337]
The next wave of monastic reform came with the Cistercian movement. The first Cistercian abbey was founded in 1098, at Cîteaux Abbey. The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to a literal observance of the Benedictine rule, rejecting the developments of the Benedictines. The most striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour, and especially to field-work. Inspired by Bernard of Clairvaux, the primary builder of the Cistercians, they became the main force of technological advancement and diffusion in medieval Europe. By the end of the 12th century, the Cistercian houses numbered 500, and at its height in the 15th century the order claimed to have close to 750 houses. Most of these were built in wilderness areas, and played a major part in bringing such isolated parts of Europe into economic cultivation.[338]
A third level of monastic reform was provided by the establishment of the Mendicant orders. Beginning in the 12th century, the Franciscan Order was instituted by the followers of Francis of Assisi, and thereafter the Dominican Order was begun by St. Dominic. Commonly known as "friars", mendicants live under a monastic rule with traditional vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience but they emphasize preaching, missionary activity, and education. The monk's new focus on reforming the world actively influenced the next 400 years of European history.[331]
It led to a new form of Christianization that went hand in hand with political centralization in the conversion of East Central Europe.[339][340] Dominicans came to dominate the new universities; they traveled about preaching against heresy, and eventually became notorious for their participation in the Medieval Inquisition, the Albigensian Crusade and the Northern crusades.[341] Christian policy denying the existence of witches and witchcraft would later be challenged by the Dominicans allowing them to participate in witch trials.[342][343]
Throughout central and eastern Europe, Christianization and political centralization went hand in hand.[339]
Conversion of the Balkan Peninsula (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia), and the area north of the Danube (Poland, Hungary, Russia), took place in the High Middle Ages. Local elites wanted to convert because they gained prestige and power through matrimonial alliances and participation in imperial rituals.[344][note 10] László Veszprémy says this created "a new region which later became known as East Central Europe".[345]
Significant missionary activity in this region only took place after Charlemagne defeated the Avar Khaganate several times at the end of the 8th century and the beginning of the ninth centuries.[346] Two Byzantine brothers, Saints Constantine-Cyril and Methodius, played the key missionary roles in spreading Christianity to Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia territories beginning in 863.[347] They spent approximately 40 months in Great Moravia continuously translating texts, teaching students, and developing the first Slavic alphabet while translating the Gospel into the Old Church Slavonic language.[348][349] Old Church Slavonic became the first literary language of the Slavs and, eventually, the educational foundation for all Slavic nations.[348]
In the last two decades of the 9th century, missionaries Clement and Naum, disciples of the brothers Cyril and Methodius, arrived in the region spreading the Cyrillic alphabet.[350] By the 10th century when the Bulgarian Tsars extended their territory to include Transylvania, they were able to impose the Bulgarian church model and its Slavic language without opposition.[351] This ecclesiastical and political tradition continued until the 19th century.[352]
The dynastic interests of the Piasts produced the establishment of both church and state in Poland.[353] The "Baptism of Poland" (Polish: Chrzest Polski) in 966, refers to the baptism of Mieszko I, the first ruler. Mieszko's baptism was followed by the building of churches and the establishment of an ecclesiastical hierarchy. Mieszko saw baptism as a way of strengthening his hold on power, with the active support he could expect from the bishops, as well as a unifying force for the Polish people.[353] "This Christian state, the earliest attempt at Christianization in this region of Europe, lasted for roughly 70 years".[353]
Around 952, the tribal chief Gyula II of Transylvania, visited Constantinople and was baptized, bringing home with him Hierotheus who was designated bishop of Turkia (Hungary).[354][355]
St. Stephen became the first Hungarian king.[356][340] He suppressed rebellion, organized the Hungarian State around strong royal authority, established the church by inviting missionaries and suppressing paganism, and by making laws such as one which required people to attend church every Sunday.[357]
Hungarian Christianity and the kingdom's ecclesiastical and temporal administrations consolidated towards the end of the 11th century, especially under Ladislas I and Coloman when the feudal order was finally established, the first saints were canonized, and new dioceses were founded.[358]
Slavic historian Ivo Štefan writes that around 978, Vladimir (978–1015), the son of Sviatoslav, seized power in Kiev, examined monotheism for himself, conquered Cherson in the Crimea, and according to the Tale of Bygone Years, was baptized there.[359] After returning to Kiev, the same text describes Vladimir as unleashing "a systematic destruction of pagan idols and the construction of Christian churches in their place".[360]
The Rus' adopted Christianity from Byzantium rather than Latin Europe, quickly developing into a specific and unique form of Rus' Christianity.[361] The Rus' dukes maintained exclusive control of the church which was financially dependent upon them.[360] The prince appointed the clergy to positions in government service; satisfied their material needs; determined who would fill the higher ecclesiastical positions; and directed the synods of bishops in the Kievan metropolitanate.[362]
This new Christian religious structure was imposed upon the socio-political and economic fabric of the land by the authority of the state's rulers.[363] According to Andrzej Poppe, Slavic historian, it is fully justifiable to call the Church of Rus' a state church.[362]
Clergy introduced literacy to all members of the princely dynasty, including women, as well as the populace.[364] Monasteries of the twelfth century became key spiritual, intellectual, art, and craft centers.[339] Under Vladimir's son Yaroslav I the Wise (1016–1018, 1019–1054), a building and cultural boom took place.[339] The Church of Rus' gradually developed into an independent political force in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.[365]
Serbian tribes adopted Christianity very slowly. The first instance of mass baptism happened during the reign of Heraclius (610–641).[366]
The full conversion of the Slavs dates to the time of Eastern Orthodox missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Basil I (r. 867–886).[366] Serbia can be seen as a "Christian nation" by 870.[367]
According to Constantine VII, conversion of the Croats began in the 7th century, and was completed by the time of Duke Trpimir's death in 864.[368] In 879, under duke Branimir, Croatia received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII.[369]
Christianization of Scandinavia is divided into two stages by Professor of medieval archaeology Alexandra Sanmark.[370] Stage 1 involves missionaries who arrive in pagan territory, on their own, without secular support.[288] This began during the Carolingian era (800s). However, early Scandinavians had been in contact with the Christian world as far back as the Migration Period (AD 375 (possibly as early as 300) to 568), and later during the Viking Age, long before the first documented missions.[371]
Early evangelization of Scandinavia was carried out by the Christianized Anglo-Saxons throughout their missions in the Scandinavian Peninsula; the most notable of the Anglo-Saxon missionaries was Ansgar, Archbishop of Bremen, nicknamed "Apostle of the North".[372] Ansgar, a native of Amiens, was sent with a group of monks to Jutland, Denmark around the year 820, at the time of the pro-Christian King Harald Klak.[372] The mission was only partially successful, and Ansgar returned two years later to Germany, after Harald had been driven out of his kingdom. In 829, Ansgar went to Birka on Lake Mälaren, Sweden, with his aide friar Witmar, and a small congregation was formed in 831 which included the king's steward Hergeir. 
According to Peter Brown, Scandinavians adopted Christianity of their own accord c.1000.[373] Anders Winroth accepts this view, explaining that Iceland became the model for the institutional conversion of the rest of Scandinavia after the farmers voted to adopt Christian law at the Assembly at Thingvellir in AD 1000.[374] Winroth demonstrates that Scandinavians were not passive recipients of the new religion, but were instead converted to Christianity because it was in individual chieftains' political, economic, and cultural interests to do so.[375]
Stage 2 begins when a secular ruler takes charge of Christianization in their territory, and ends when a defined and organized ecclesiastical network is established.[376] By 1350, Scandinavia was an integral part of Western Christendom.[377] Conversion was slow, however, and most Scandinavian lands were only completely Christianized at the time of rulers such as Saint Canute IV of Denmark and Olaf I of Norway in the years following AD 1000.
Many differences between East and West had existed since Antiquity. Since eastern emperors saw the church as an arm of the government, and kept much of that power for themselves, the eastern Patriarch never had the power the Pope eventually acquired.[182] Disagreements over whether Pope or Patriarch should lead the church, whether that should be done in Latin or Greek, whether priests must remain celibate and other points of doctrine, were intensified by cultural, geographical, geopolitical, and linguistic differences between East and West.[378][182]
Theological disagreements had exasperated the difficulties. One was over the Filioque clause, a single sentence inserted by the West into the Nicene Creed by the Third Council of Toledo in 589.[378] It contends that the third part of the Triune God, the Holy Spirit, proceeds from both Father and Son making them equal. It was intended as an anti-Arian measure, and King Reccared I and some Arians in his Visigothic Kingdom converted to orthodox, Catholic Christianity because of it.[379] The Eastern Church argued that the phrase had been added unilaterally and therefore illegitimately, since the East had not been consulted and they disagreed theologically. The original Creed, sanctioned by the councils and still used today by the Eastern Orthodox, simply states "the Holy Spirit, ... proceeds from the Father."[380][381]
Eventually, this produced the East–West Schism, also known as the "Great Schism" of 1054, which separated the Church into Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.[378]
Modern western universities have their origins directly in the Medieval Church.[382][383][384][385][386] They began as cathedral schools, and all students were considered clerics.[387] This was a benefit as it placed the students under ecclesiastical jurisdiction and thus imparted certain legal immunities and protections. The cathedral schools eventually became partially detached from the cathedrals and formed their own institutions, the earliest being the University of Bologna (1088), the University of Oxford (1096), and the University of Paris (c. 1150).[388][389][390]
The Investiture controversy, otherwise referred to as the "Lay Investiture controversy", was the most significant conflict between secular and religious powers that took place in medieval Europe.[391] It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII concerning who would appoint bishops (investiture).[392] Ending lay investiture threatened to undercut the power of the Holy Roman Empire and the ambitions of the European nobility. But allowing lay investiture meant the Pope's authority over his own people was limited.[393]
Bishoprics being merely lifetime appointments, a king could better control their powers and revenues than those of hereditary noblemen. Even better, he could leave the post vacant and collect the revenues, theoretically in trust for the new bishop, or give a bishopric to pay a helpful noble.[393] The Roman Catholic Church wanted to end lay investiture to end this and other abuses, to reform the episcopate and provide better pastoral care and separation of church and state.[394] Pope Gregory VII issued the Dictatus Papae, which declared that the pope alone could appoint bishops.[394] Henry IV's rejection of the decree led to his excommunication and a ducal revolt. Eventually, Henry IV received absolution after a dramatic public penance, though the Great Saxon Revolt and conflict of investiture continued.[395] It took "five decades of excommunications, denunciations and mutual depositions...spanning the reign of two emperors and six popes" to settle the controversy in 1122.[396]
A similar controversy occurred in England between King Henry I and St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, over investiture and episcopal vacancy.[397] The English dispute was resolved by the Concordat of London (1107), where the king renounced his claim to invest bishops but continued to require an oath of fealty. This was a partial model for the Concordat of Worms (Pactum Calixtinum), which resolved the Imperial investiture controversy with a compromise that allowed secular authorities some measure of control but granted the selection of bishops to their cathedral canons.[396] As a symbol of the compromise, both ecclesiastical and lay authorities invested bishops with the staff and the ring, respectively.[397]
Generally, the Crusades (1095–1291) refer to the European Christian campaigns in the Holy Land sponsored by the Papacy against Muslims in order to reconquer the region of Palestine.[398][399][400] There were other Crusader expeditions against the Islamic forces in the Mediterranean, primarily in Southern Spain, Southern Italy, and the islands of Cyprus, Malta, and Sicily.[399] The Papacy also sponsored numerous Crusades against the Pagan peoples of Northeastern Europe in order to subjugate and forcibly convert them to Christianity,[398] against its political enemies in Western Europe, and against heretical or schismatic religious minorities within European Christendom.[401]
The Holy Land had been part of the Roman Empire, and thus subsequently of the Byzantine Empire, until the Arab Muslim invasions of the 7th and 8th centuries. Thereafter, Christians had generally been permitted to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land until 1071, when the Seljuk Turks closed Christian pilgrimages and assailed the Byzantines, defeating them at the Battle of Manzikert. Emperor Alexius I asked for aid from Pope Urban II against Islamic aggression. He probably expected money from the pope for the hiring of mercenaries. Instead, Urban II called upon the knights of Christendom in a speech made at the Council of Clermont on 27 November 1095, combining the idea of pilgrimage to the Holy Land with that of defending the defenseless by waging a holy war against infidels.[402]
The First Crusade captured Antioch in 1099 and then Jerusalem. The Second Crusade occurred in 1145 when Edessa was taken by Islamic forces. Jerusalem was held until 1187 and the Third Crusade, after battles between Richard the Lionheart and Saladin. The Fourth Crusade, begun by Innocent III in 1202, intended to retake the Holy Land but was soon subverted by the Venetians. When the crusaders arrived in Constantinople, they sacked the city and other parts of Asia Minor and established the Latin Empire of Constantinople in Greece and Asia Minor. Five numbered crusades to the Holy Land, culminating in the siege of Acre of 1219, essentially ending the Western presence in the Holy Land.[403]
Jerusalem was held by the crusaders for nearly a century, while other strongholds in the Near East remained in Christian possession much longer. The crusades in the Holy Land ultimately failed to establish permanent Christian kingdoms. Islamic expansion into Europe remained a threat for centuries, culminating in the campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent in the 16th century. 
When the Pope (Blessed) Eugenius III (1145–1153) called for a Second Crusade in response to the fall of Edessa in 1144, Saxon nobles in Eastern Europe refused to go.[404] From the days of Charlemagne (747-814), the free barbarian people around the Baltic Sea had raided the countries that surrounded them including Denmark, Prussia, Germany and Poland, stealing crucial resources, killing, and enslaving captives.[405] For the leaders of these countries, that meant subduing the Baltic area was more important to them than going to the Levant.[404] In 1147, Eugenius' Divini dispensatione, gave the eastern nobles crusade indulgences for the Baltic area.[404][406][407] The Northern, (or Baltic), Crusades followed, taking place, off and on, with and without papal support, from 1147 to 1316.[408][409][410]
These rulers did not see crusading as a moral, faith based duty as western crusaders did. They saw holy war as a tool for territorial expansion, alliance building, and the empowerment of their own young church and state.[411] Law professor Eric Christiansen says their primary motivation was territorial expansion.[412][413] Between 1147 when Pope Eugene called for crusade, and 1347 when bubonic plague arrived in Europe, the intervening 200 years saw the greatest territorial expansion of medieval German history: 2,214 towns on the southern shores of the Baltic Sea were chartered, "903 were chartered within regions across the Elbe river, along the Baltic coast northwest of the old heartland of the German kingdom."[414][note 11]
Taking the time for peaceful conversion did not fit in with these plans.[415] Conversion by these princes was almost always a result of conquest, either by the direct use of force, or indirectly, when a leader converted and required it of his followers.[416] Monks and priests had to work with the secular rulers on the ruler's terms.[417]
According to Fonnesberg-Schmidt, "While the theologians maintained that conversion should be voluntary, there was a widespread pragmatic acceptance of conversion obtained through political pressure or military coercion".[418] Acceptance led some commentators to endorse and approve coerced conversions, something that had not been done in the church before this time.[419][418] Dominican friars helped with this ideological shift by offering a portrayal of the pagans as possessed by evil spirits. In this manner, they could assert that pagans were in need of conquest in order to free them from their terrible circumstance; then they could be peacefully converted.[420][421][422] There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist.[423][424][425]
The Medieval Inquisition, including the Episcopal Inquisition (1184–1230) and the later Papal Inquisition (1230s–1240s), was a type of criminal court established and run by the Roman Catholic Church from around 1184. This is the period when heresy had reappeared after it disappeared at the end of Antiquity.[426] Popes started to pay attention to stopping it in order to unify the church, which was thought necessary for establishing the Pope as the central authority of Christendom.[427]
Inquisition had its origins in Roman Law and was an evolution in the Western method of legal prosecution.[428][429] It placed an overseeing authority into the position of the "wronged party" who made the accusation against the suspect; then that same authority did the investigating; finally, that same authority also judged their guilt.[428]
Dependent upon undependable secular support, inquisitions dealt largely, but not exclusively, with religious issues such as heresy.[428] Inquisition was not a unified single bureaucratic institution.[430][429] Jurisdiction was often local and limited; lack of support and outright opposition often obstructed it; and many parts of Europe had erratic inquisitions or none at all.[430]
Historian Christine Caldwell Ames writes that Dominican inquisitors saw their work as proving the "true faith" by interpreting Christ as the just persecutor of evil.[428] Ames calls this a "measured manipulation of the Christian faith" supported by circumstance, since heresy had exploded across Christendom in the 11th century.[426] Deane notes that inquisition emerged at the same time Europe was experiencing a cultural flowering through the newly established "universities, cathedrals, literature, urbanization and long distance trade".[431]
At the same time, inquisition was contested stridently through continuous and various kinds of opposition and complaint, both in and outside the church. Opponents charged heresy inquisitions with proving the Roman church was "unchristian" and "a destroyer of its gospel legacy, or even the real enemy of Christ".[432]
By 1150, a watershed period in European history had begun.[433] Western culture became more secular as Kings actively worked to centralize power into themselves and their nations. This was accomplished by taking legal, military, and social powers away from the aristocrats who had traditionally held such powers. Prior to this, social and legal complaints were handled locally, and the judgment of the local “kinship group” with its aristocratic leader, was universally recognized as the fundamental authority.[434] In the Twelfth century, the 'state'  attacked the older kinship systems by “creating what are in effect victimless crimes” and prosecuting them itself.[435]
These victimless crimes had been redefined as “threats” to the social order in an ongoing rhetoric by and among the mid-level elite in both secular and church government.[435] Proactively pursuing the punishment of the threats that rhetoric had, itself, created became part of what legitimated the state and its authority.[435] Stereotyping, propaganda and the legal prosecution of minorities functioned socially and politically as the mechanism that enabled the transfer of power.[436] By 1200, local authority had been replaced by inquisition, where an authority from without "interrogates, orders, and classifies local knowledge in order to render judgment from on high".[434]

Jews and homosexuals were among the first minorities to lose rights and be persecuted by law.[437] Attitudes of the church toward the Jews changed in the 1200s, and the church no longer attempted to protect them.[438][439] Since Augustine, the church had advocated freedom for the Jews. During the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church still upheld the Constitutio pro Judæis (Formal Statement on the Jews): We decree that no Christian shall use violence to force them to be baptized, so long as they are unwilling and refuse.…Without the judgment of the political authority of the land, no Christian shall presume to wound them or kill them or rob them of their money or change the good customs that they have thus far enjoyed in the place where they live."[440]Constitutio pro Judæis were papal bulls which set out the official position of the papacy regarding the treatment of Jews. The first bull by that name was issued in about 1120 by Calixtus II and served as a papal charter of protection to Jews. It was prompted by attacks on Jews by the First Crusade, during which over five thousand Jews were slaughtered in Europe. The bull forbade Christians, on pain of excommunication, from forcing Jews to convert, harming them, taking their property, disturbing the celebration of their festivals and interfering with their cemeteries.[441]
In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council, known as the Great Council, met and accepted 70 canons (church laws).[442] The last three canons required Jews to distinguish themselves from Christians in their dress, prohibited them from holding public office, and prohibited Jewish converts from continuing to practice Jewish rituals.[443] As Berger has articulated it: "The other side of the coin of unique toleration was unique persecution."[438]
In the eleventh century, the kingdom of Jerusalem had spread a legal code ordaining death for "sodomites". From the 1250s onwards, a series of similar legal codes in the nation-states of Spain, France, Italy and Germany followed this example. Sociologist R. I. Moore writes that "By 1300, places where male sodomy was not a capitol offense had become the exception rather than the rule."[444]
They were followed in the next few centuries by Gypsies, beggars, spendthrifts, prostitutes, and idle former soldiers.[445]
Moore writes that persecution was not innate to the period or pathological or simply a moral failing of the time; it was a functional tool of power.[434] Persecution thereby became a core element in the social and political development of Western society.[446][447][448] The church did not have the leading role in this process, but the church was part of it.[449][450][451] There were moments of persecution before this, but it is only across the twelfth century that persecution becomes habitual and enmeshed in the new systems of government and authority.[435] As Moore says, persecution had "found its way to the heart of things, [and] there it then stayed ever after".[435]
The popes of the fourteenth century worked to amass power into the papal position, building what is often called the papal monarchy.[452][453] This was accomplished partly through the reorganization of the ecclesiastical financial system. The poor had previously been allowed to offer their tithes in goods and services, but these popes revamped the system to only accept money.[452] A steady cash flow brought with it the power of great wealth. The papal states were thereafter governed by the pope in the same manner the secular powers governed. The pope became a pseudo-monarch.[452]
These fourteenth century popes were greedy and politically corrupt, so that pious Christians of the period became disgusted, leading to the loss of papal prestige.[452][454] Ullmann writes: "What the observer of the papacy witnessed in [these] centuries was a gradual, though clearly perceptible, decomposition of Europe as a single ecclesiastical unit, and the fragmentation of Europe into independent, autonomous entities which were soon to be called national monarchies or states. This fragmentation heralded the withering away of the papacy as a governing institution operating on a universal scale."[455]
Devoted and virtuous nuns and monks became increasingly rare. Monastic reform had been a major force in the High Middle Ages, but it is largely unknown in the Late Middle Ages.[456] People living during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries experienced plague, famine and war that ravaged most of the continent; there was social unrest, urban riots, peasant revolts and renegade feudal armies, and this was in addition to the religious changes often forced upon them by their new monarchies. They faced all of this with a church unable to provide much moral leadership as a result of its own internal conflict and corruption.[457]
The church reached its nadir from 1309 to 1377 when there were three different men claiming to be the rightful Pope.[458][452]
The Avignon Papacy, sometimes referred to as the Babylonian Captivity, was a period from 1309 to 1378 during which seven popes resided in Avignon, in modern-day France.[459] In 1309, Pope Clement V moved to Avignon in southern France. Confusion and political animosity waxed, as the prestige and influence of Rome waned without a resident pontiff. Troubles reached their peak in 1378 when Gregory XI died while visiting Rome. A papal conclave met in Rome and elected Urban VI, an Italian. Urban soon alienated the French cardinals, and they held a second conclave electing Robert of Geneva to succeed Gregory XI, beginning the Western Schism.[458][460]
John Wycliffe, an English scholastic philosopher and Christian theologian best known for denouncing the abuses and corruption of the Catholic Church, was a precursor of the Protestant Reformation.[461] He emphasized the supremacy of the Bible and called for a direct relationship between God and the human person, without interference by priests and bishops.[461] The Lollards, a Proto-Protestant Christian movement that followed the teachings of Wycliffe, played a role in the English Reformation.[461][462][463] Jan Hus, a Czech Christian theologian based in Prague, was influenced by Wycliffe and spoke out against the abuses and corruption he saw in the Catholic Church.[464] His followers became known as the Hussites, a Proto-Protestant Christian movement that followed the teachings of Jan Hus, who became the best known representative of the Bohemian Reformation.[464][461] He was a forerunner of the Protestant Reformation,[464][461] and his legacy has become a powerful symbol of Czech culture in Bohemia.[465] Both Wycliffe and Hus were accused of heresy and subsequently condemned to the death penalty for their outspoken views about the Catholic Church.[466][464][461]
The Renaissance was a period of great cultural change and achievement, marked in Italy by a classical orientation and an increase of wealth through mercantile trade. The city of Rome, the papacy, and the papal states were all affected by the Renaissance. On the one hand, it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence, where the Church commissioned such artists as Michelangelo, Brunelleschi, Bramante, Raphael, Fra Angelico, Donatello, and Leonardo da Vinci. On the other hand, wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices, including the papacy, for their own members, some of whom were known for immorality, such as Alexander VI and Sixtus IV.
In addition to being the head of the Church, the pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers, and pontiffs such as Julius II often waged campaigns to protect and expand their temporal domains. Furthermore, the popes, in a spirit of refined competition with other Italian lords, spent lavishly both on private luxuries but also on public works, repairing or building churches, bridges, and a magnificent system of aqueducts in Rome that still function today.
In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire. Eastern Christians fleeing Constantinople, and the Greek manuscripts they carried with them, is one of the factors that prompted the literary renaissance in the West at about this time.[467] The Ottoman government followed Islamic law when dealing with the conquered Christian population. Christians were officially tolerated as people of the Book. As such, the Church's canonical and hierarchical organisation were not significantly disrupted, and its administration continued to function. One of the first things that Mehmet the Conqueror did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, Gennadius Scholarius. However, these rights and privileges, including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. Christians were viewed as second-class citizens, and the legal protections they depended upon were subject to the whims of the sultan and the sublime porte.[468][469] The Hagia Sophia and the Parthenon, which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium, were converted into mosques. Violent persecutions of Christians were common and reached their climax in the Armenian, Assyrian, and Greek genocides.[470][471]
Following the geographic discoveries of the 1400s and 1500s, increasing population and inflation led the emerging nation-states of Portugal, Spain, and France, the Dutch Republic, and England to explore, conquer, colonize and exploit the newly discovered territories.[474] While colonialism was primarily economic and political, it also opened the door for Christian missions.[475][476] Some missionaries supported colonialism and an almost equal number opposed it.[23] According to historical theologian Justo Gonzales, colonialism and missions each sometimes aided and sometimes impeded the other.[477]
Different state actors created colonies that varied widely.[478] Some colonies had institutions that allowed native populations to reap some benefits. Others became extractive colonies with predatory rule that produced an autocracy with a dismal record.[479] Beginning with the first wave of European colonization, there was often religious discrimination along with racial and political discrimination, persecution, and violence toward the people and their native religions.[24][25][26][27][472][473]
A catastrophe was wrought upon the Amerindians by contact with Europeans. Old World diseases like smallpox, measles, malaria and many others spread through Indian populations. "In most of the New World 90 percent or more of the native population was destroyed by wave after wave of previously unknown afflictions. Explorers and colonists did not enter an empty land but rather an emptied one".[480]
Under Spanish and Portuguese rule, creating a Christian Commonwealth was the goal of colonization. This included a significant role, from the beginning of colonial rule, played by Catholic missionaries.[481] During the Age of Discovery and the following centuries, the Spanish and Portuguese colonial empires were the most active in attempting to convert the Indigenous peoples of the Americas to the Christian religion.[24][25]
During Columbus's second voyage, Benedictine friars accompanied him, along with twelve other priests. With the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire, evangelization of the dense Indigenous populations was undertaken in what was called the "spiritual conquest".[482] Friars aimed at converting Indigenous leaders, with the hope and expectation that their communities would follow suit.[483]
Portugal practiced extractive colonialism, and the Spanish military was known for its ill-treatment of Amerindians.[484] Spanish missionaries are generally credited with championing efforts to initiate protective laws for the Indians and for working against their enslavement.[485][note 12]
Throughout the Americas, the Jesuits were active in attempting to convert the Indigenous peoples to Christianity. They had considerable success on the frontiers in New France,[491] Portuguese Brazil, and Antonio de Vieira, S.J;[492] and in Paraguay, almost an autonomous state within a state.[493] On the one hand, California missionaries sought to protect the Amerindians from exploitation by the conquistadores, soldiers and colonists. On the other hand, Jesuits, Franciscans and other orders relied on corporal punishment and an institutionalized racialism for training the "untamed savages".[494]
In the seventeenth century, the French used assimilation as a means of establishing colonies controlled by the state rather than private companies.[495] Within the context of western geocentrism, assimilation (integration of a small group into a larger one) has been used to legitimize European colonization morally and politically for centuries.[496] It advocated multiple aspects of European culture such as "civility, social organization, law, economic development, civil status," dress, bodily description, religion and more to the exclusion of local culture.[497] This was linked with the emergence of the modern state and was instrumental in the development of racialism.[498][499]
The Dutch Reformed church was not a dominant influence in the Dutch colonies.[500] However, the Dutch East Indies Trading Company used assimilation in its Asian port towns, encouraging intermarriage and cultural uniformity, to establish colonies.[501]
Great Britain's colonial expansion was for the most part driven by commercial ambitions and competition with France.[502] Investors saw converting the natives as a secondary concern.[503] Historian Jacob Schacter says "ambivalent benevolence" was at the heart of most British and American attitudes toward Native Americans.[504]
Having continued as a dhimmi community under the Sunni Caliphate after the Muslim conquest of Persia (633–654), the Church of the East played a major role in the history of Christianity in Asia. Between the 9th and 14th centuries, it represented the world's largest Christian denomination in terms of geographical extent. It established dioceses and communities stretching from the Mediterranean Sea and today's Iraq and Iran, to India (the Saint Thomas Syrian Christians of Kerala), the Mongol kingdoms in Central Asia, the Turkic tribes in Central Asia,[505] and China during the Tang dynasty (7th–9th centuries). In the 13th and 14th centuries, the church experienced a final period of expansion under the Mongol Empire, where influential Church of the East clergy sat in the Mongol court.[506]
In the early 16th century, attempts were made by the Christian theologians Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli, along with many others, to reform the Catholic Church. They considered the roots of corruption within the Catholic Church and its ecclesiastical structure to be doctrinal, rather than simply a matter of depravity, moral weakness, or lack of ecclesiastical discipline, and thus advocated for God's autonomy in redemption, and against voluntaristic notions that salvation could be earned by people. The Reformation is usually considered to have started with the publication of the Ninety-five Theses by Luther in 1517, although there was no schism until the 1521 Diet of Worms. The edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas.[507]
The word Protestant is derived from the Latin protestatio, meaning declaration, which refers to the letter of protestation by Lutheran princes against the decision of the Diet of Speyer in 1529, which reaffirmed the edict of the Diet of Worms ordering the seizure of all property owned by persons guilty of advocating Lutheranism.[508] The term "Protestant" was not originally used by Reformation era leaders; instead, they called themselves "evangelical", emphasising the "return to the true gospel (Greek: euangelion)".[509]
Early protest was against corruptions such as simony, the holding of multiple church offices by one person at the same time, episcopal vacancies, and the sale of indulgences. The Protestant position also included the Five solae (sola scriptura, sola fide, sola gratia, solus Christus, soli Deo gloria), the priesthood of all believers, Law and Gospel, and the two kingdoms doctrine. The three most important traditions to emerge directly from the Reformation were the Lutheran, Reformed, and Anglican traditions, though the latter group identifies as both "Reformed" and "Catholic", and some subgroups reject the classification as "Protestant".
Unlike other reform movements, the English Reformation began by royal influence. Henry VIII considered himself a thoroughly Catholic king, and in 1521 he defended the papacy against Luther in a book he commissioned entitled, The Defence of the Seven Sacraments, for which Pope Leo X awarded him the title Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith). However, the king came into conflict with the papacy when he wished to annul his marriage with Catherine of Aragon, for which he needed papal sanction. Catherine, among many other noble relations, was the aunt of Emperor Charles V, the papacy's most significant secular supporter. The ensuing dispute eventually lead to a break from Rome and the declaration of the King of England as head of the English Church, which saw itself as a Protestant church navigating a middle way between Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity, but leaning more towards the latter.[510] Consequently, England experienced periods of reform and also Counter-Reformation. Monarchs such as Edward VI, Lady Jane Grey, Mary I, Elizabeth I, and Archbishops of Canterbury such as Thomas Cranmer and William Laud, pushed the Church of England in different directions over the course of only a few generations. What emerged was the Elizabethan Religious Settlement and a state church that considered itself both "Reformed" and "Catholic" but not "Roman", and other unofficial more radical movements, such as the Puritans. In terms of politics, the English Reformation included heresy trials, the exiling of Roman Catholic populations to Spain and other Roman Catholic lands, and censorship and prohibition of books.[511]
Protestantism has promoted economic growth and entrepreneurship, especially in the period after the Scientific and the Industrial Revolution.[512][513] Scholars have identified a positive correlation between the rise of Protestantism and human capital formation,[514] work ethic,[515] economic development,[516] and the development of the state system.[517] According to the Merton Thesis, there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand, and early experimental science on the other.[518][519][520]
The Radical Reformation represented a response to corruption both in the Catholic Church and in the expanding Magisterial Protestant movement led by Martin Luther and many others. Beginning in Germany and Switzerland in the 16th century, the Radical Reformation gave birth to many radical Protestant groups throughout Europe. The term covers radical reformers like Thomas Müntzer and Andreas Karlstadt, the Zwickau prophets, and Anabaptist Christians, most notably the Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, the Bruderhof Communities, and Schwarzenau Brethren.
The Counter-Reformation was the response of the Catholic Church to the Protestant Reformation. In terms of meetings and documents, it consisted of the Confutatio Augustana, the Council of Trent, the Roman Catechism, and the Defensio Tridentinæ fidei. In terms of politics, the Counter-Reformation included heresy trials, the exiling of Protestant populations from Catholic lands, the seizure of children from their Protestant parents for institutionalized Catholic upbringing, a series of wars, the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (the list of prohibited books), and the Spanish Inquisition.
Although Protestant Christians were excommunicated in an attempt to reduce their influence within the Catholic Church, at the same time they were persecuted during the Counter-Reformation, prompting some to live as crypto-Protestants (also termed Nicodemites), against the urging of John Calvin who urged them to live their faith openly.[521] Crypto-Protestants were documented as late as the 19th century in Latin America.[522]
The Council of Trent (1545–1563) initiated by Pope Paul III addressed issues of certain ecclesiastical corruptions such as simony, absenteeism, nepotism, the holding of multiple church offices by one person, and other abuses. It also reasserted traditional practices and doctrines of the Church, such as the episcopal structure, clerical celibacy, the seven Sacraments, transubstantiation (the belief that during mass the consecrated bread and wine truly become the body and blood of Christ), the veneration of relics, icons, and saints (especially the Blessed Virgin Mary), the necessity of both faith and good works for salvation, the existence of purgatory and the issuance (but not the sale) of indulgences. In other words, all Protestant doctrinal objections and changes were uncompromisingly rejected. The council also fostered an interest in education for parish priests to increase pastoral care. Milan's Archbishop Saint Charles Borromeo set an example by visiting the remotest parishes and instilling high standards.
Simultaneous to the Counter-Reformation, the Catholic Reformation consisted of improvements in art and culture, anti-corruption measures, the founding of the Jesuits, the establishment of seminaries, a reassertion of traditional doctrines and the emergence of new religious orders aimed at both moral reform and new missionary activity. Also part of this was the development of new yet orthodox forms of spirituality, such as that of the Spanish mystics and the French school of spirituality.
The papacy of St. Pius V was known not only for its focus on halting heresy and worldly abuses within the Church, but also for its focus on improving popular piety in a determined effort to stem the appeal of Protestantism. Pius began his pontificate by giving large alms to the poor, charity, and hospitals, and the pontiff was known for consoling the poor and sick as well as supporting missionaries. These activities coincided with a rediscovery of the ancient Christian catacombs in Rome. As Diarmaid MacCulloch states, "Just as these ancient martyrs were revealed once more, Catholics were beginning to be martyred afresh, both in mission fields overseas and in the struggle to win back Protestant northern Europe: the catacombs proved to be an inspiration for many to action and to heroism."[523]
Catholic missions were carried to new places beginning with the new Age of Discovery, and the Roman Catholic Church established missions in the Americas.
The Galileo affair, in which Galileo Galilei came into conflict with the Roman Catholic Church over his support of heliocentrism, is often considered a defining moment in the history of the relationship between religion and science. In 1610, Galileo published his Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new telescope. These and other discoveries exposed major difficulties with the understanding of the heavens that had been held since antiquity, and raised new interest in radical teachings such as the heliocentric theory of Copernicus. In reaction, many scholars maintained that the motion of the earth and immobility of the sun were heretical, as they contradicted some accounts given in the Bible as understood at that time. Galileo's part in the controversies over his theological and philosophical positions culminated in his trial and sentencing in 1633, on a grave suspicion of heresy. 
Most contemporary historians of science agree that Galileo affair as an exception, with the relationship between science and Christianity, and have corrected numerous false interpretations of the affair.[524][525][526][527] Some scholars and historians attribute Christianity to having contributed to the rise of the Scientific Revolution.[528]
The colonization with the most impact in the New World was that of Protestant English Puritans in North America. Unlike the Spanish or French, the English colonists made surprisingly little effort to evangelize the native peoples.[529] The Puritans, or Pilgrims, left England so that they could live in an area with Puritanism established as the exclusive civic religion. Though they had left England because of the suppression of their religious practice, most Puritans had thereafter originally settled in the Low Countries but found the licentiousness there, where the state hesitated from enforcing religious practice, as unacceptable, and thus they set out for the New World and the hopes of a Puritan utopia.
Christian revivalism refers to the Calvinist and Wesleyan revival, called the "Great Awakening" in North America, which saw the development of evangelical Congregationalist, Presbyterian, Baptist, and new Methodist churches.
The First Great Awakening was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants in the American colonies c. 1730–1740, emphasising the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching, rudimentary liturgy, and a deep sense of personal guilt and redemption by Christ Jesus. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom saw it as part of a "great international Protestant upheaval" that also created pietism in Germany, the Evangelical Revival, and Methodism in England.[530] It centred on reviving the spirituality of established congregations and mostly affected Congregational, Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed, German Reformed, Baptist, and Methodist churches, while also spreading within the slave population. The Second Great Awakening (1800–1830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. It also sparked the beginnings of groups such as the Mormons, the Restoration Movement and the Holiness movement. The Third Great Awakening began from 1857 and was most notable for taking the movement throughout the world, especially in English speaking countries. The final group to emerge from the "great awakenings" in North America was Pentecostalism, which had its roots in the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Holiness movements, and began in 1906 on Azusa Street in Los Angeles. Pentecostalism would later lead to the Charismatic movement.
Restorationism refers to the belief that a purer form of Christianity should be restored using the early church as a model.[531]: 635 [532]: 217  In many cases, restorationist groups believed that contemporary Christianity, in all of its forms, had deviated from the true, original Christianity, which they then attempted to "reconstruct", often using the Book of Acts as a "guidebook" of sorts. Usually, Restorationists do not describe themselves as "reforming" a Christian church which has continuously existed since the time of Jesus, instead, they describe themselves as restoring the Church that they believe was lost at some point in the history of Christianity. "Restorationism" is frequently used to describe the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement.
The term "restorationist" is also used to describe movements such as Adventism, a movement which originated in the 1830s in the United States during the Second Great Awakening when Baptist preacher William Miller first publicly shared his belief that the Second Coming would occur at some point between 1843 and 1844, and the Jehovah's Witness movement, founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell. The term can also be used to describe the Latter Day Saint movement, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Community of Christ and numerous other Latter Day Saint denominations. Latter Day Saints, also known as Mormons, believe that Joseph Smith was chosen to restore the original organization which was established by Jesus, now "in its fullness", rather than reform the church.[533][534]
The Russian Orthodox Church held a privileged position in the Russian Empire, expressed in the motto of the late empire from 1833: Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Populism. Nevertheless, the Church reform of Peter I in the early 18th century had placed the Orthodox authorities under the control of the tsar. An ober-procurator appointed by the tsar ran the committee which governed the Church between 1721 and 1918: the Most Holy Synod.
The Church became involved in the various campaigns of russification,[535] and was accused of involvement in Russian antisemitism,[536] despite the lack of an official position on Judaism as such.[537]
The Bolsheviks and other Russian revolutionaries saw the Church, like the tsarist state, as an enemy of the people. Criticism of atheism was strictly forbidden and sometimes lead to imprisonment.[538][539][540] Some actions against Orthodox priests and believers included torture, being sent to prison camps, labour camps or mental hospitals, as well as execution.[541][542]
In the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.[544] This included people like the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna who was at this point a monastic. Executed along with her were: Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich Romanov; the Princes Ioann Konstantinvich, Konstantin Konstantinovich, Igor Konstantinovich and Vladimir Pavlovich Paley; Grand Duke Sergei's secretary, Fyodor Remez; and Varvara Yakovleva, a sister from the Grand Duchess Elizabeth's convent.
Liberal Christianity, sometimes called liberal theology, is an umbrella term covering diverse, philosophically informed religious movements and moods within late 18th, 19th and 20th-century Christianity. The word "liberal" in liberal Christianity does not refer to a leftist political agenda or set of beliefs, but rather to the freedom of dialectic process associated with continental philosophy and other philosophical and religious paradigms developed during the Age of Enlightenment.
Fundamentalist Christianity is a movement that arose mainly within British and American Protestantism in the late 19th century and early 20th century in reaction to modernism and certain liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to Christianity yet still called themselves "Christian". Thus, fundamentalism sought to re-establish tenets that could not be denied without relinquishing a Christian identity, the "fundamentals": inerrancy of the Bible, the principle of sola scriptura, the Virgin Birth of Jesus, the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection of Jesus, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ.
Under the state atheism of countries in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, Christians of many denominations experienced persecution, with many churches and monasteries being destroyed, as well as clergy being executed.[545][546][547]
The position of Christians affected by Nazism is highly complex.[548] Pope Pius XI declared – Mit brennender Sorge – that Fascist governments had hidden "pagan intentions" and expressed the irreconcilability of the Catholic position and totalitarian fascist state worship, which placed the nation above God, fundamental human rights, and dignity. His declaration that "Spiritually, [Christians] are all Semites" prompted the Nazis to give him the title "Chief Rabbi of the Christian World".[549]
Catholic priests were executed in concentration camps alongside Jews; for example, 2,600 Catholic priests were imprisoned in Dachau, and 2,000 of them were executed (cf. Priesterblock). A further 2,700 Polish priests were executed (a quarter of all Polish priests), and 5,350 Polish nuns were either displaced, imprisoned, or executed.[550] Many Catholic laymen and clergy played notable roles in sheltering Jews during the Holocaust, including Pope Pius XII. The head rabbi of Rome became a Catholic in 1945 and, in honour of the actions the pope undertook to save Jewish lives, he took the name Eugenio (the pope's first name).[551] A former Israeli consul in Italy claimed: "The Catholic Church saved more Jewish lives during the war than all the other churches, religious institutions, and rescue organisations put together."[552]
The relationship between Nazism and Protestantism, especially the German Lutheran Church, was complex. Though many[553] Protestant church leaders in Germany supported the Nazis' growing anti-Jewish activities, some such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer (a Lutheran pastor) of the Confessing Church, a movement within Protestantism that strongly opposed Nazism, were strongly opposed to the Third Reich. Bonhoeffer was later found guilty in the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed.
On 11 October 1962, Pope John XXIII opened the Second Vatican Council, the 21st ecumenical council of the Catholic Church. The council was "pastoral" in nature, interpreting dogma in terms of its scriptural roots, revising liturgical practices, and providing guidance for articulating traditional Church teachings in contemporary times. The council is perhaps best known for its instructions that the Mass may be celebrated in the vernacular as well as in Latin.
Ecumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue. Ecumenism is derived from Greek οἰκουμένη (oikoumene), which means "the inhabited world", but more figuratively something like "universal oneness". The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements, with the latter characterised by a redefined ecclesiology of "denominationalism" (which the Catholic Church, among others, rejects).
Over the last century, moves have been made to reconcile the schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches. Although progress has been made, concerns over papal primacy and the independence of the smaller Orthodox churches has blocked a final resolution of the schism. On 30 November 1894, Pope Leo XIII published Orientalium Dignitas. On 7 December 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I was issued lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054.
Some of the most difficult questions in relations with the ancient Eastern Churches concern some doctrine (i.e. Filioque, scholasticism, functional purposes of asceticism, the essence of God, Hesychasm, Fourth Crusade, establishment of the Latin Empire, Uniatism to note but a few) as well as practical matters such as the concrete exercise of the claim to papal primacy and how to ensure that ecclesiastical union would not mean mere absorption of the smaller Churches by the Latin component of the much larger Catholic Church (the most numerous single religious denomination in the world) and the stifling or abandonment of their own rich theological, liturgical and cultural heritage.
With respect to Catholic relations with Protestant communities, certain commissions were established to foster dialogue and documents have been produced aimed at identifying points of doctrinal unity, such as the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification produced with the Lutheran World Federation in 1999. Ecumenical movements within Protestantism have focused on determining a list of doctrines and practices essential to being Christian and thus extending to all groups which fulfill these basic criteria a (more or less) co-equal status, with perhaps one's own group still retaining a "first among equal" standing. This process involved a redefinition of the idea of "the Church" from traditional theology. This ecclesiology, known as denominationalism, contends that each group (which fulfills the essential criteria of "being Christian") is a sub-group of a greater "Christian Church", itself a purely abstract concept with no direct representation, i.e., no group, or "denomination", claims to be "the Church". This ecclesiology is at variance with other groups that indeed consider themselves to be "the Church". The "essential criteria" generally consist of belief in the Trinity, belief that Jesus Christ is the only way to bring forgiveness and eternal life, and that Jesus died and rose again bodily.
In reaction to these developments, Christian fundamentalism emerged as a socio-political-religious movement in rejection of what many Christians perceived as radical influences of philosophical humanism that were affecting the Christian religion, according to them. Especially targeting critical approaches to the interpretation of the Bible, and trying to blockade the inroads made into their churches by secular scientific assumptions, fundamentalist Christians began to appear in various Christian denominations as numerous independent movements of resistance to the developments that they regarded as a drift away from historical Christianity. Over time, the Evangelical movement has divided into two main wings, with the label Fundamentalist following one branch, while the term Evangelical has become the preferred banner of the more moderate side. Although both strands of Evangelicalism primarily originated in the English-speaking world, the majority of Evangelicals today live elsewhere in the world.
World Christianity, otherwise known as "global Christianity", has been defined both as a term that attempts to convey the global nature of the Christian religion[31][34][556] and an academic field of study that encompasses analysis of the histories, practices, and discourses of Christianity as a world religion and its various forms as they are found on the six continents.[557] However, the term often focuses on "non-Western Christianity" which "comprises (usually the exotic) instances of Christian faith in 'the global South', in Asia, Africa, and Latin America".[558] It also includes Indigenous or diasporic forms of Christianity in the Caribbean,[555] South America,[555] Western Europe,[559] and North America.[559]
He also voiced his support for the preservation of temple buildings, but failed to prevent damaging several holy sites in the eastern provinces which most scholars believe was sponsored by Cynegius, Theodosius' praetorian prefect.[234][235][236] Some scholars have held Theodosius responsible for his prefect's behavior. Following Cynegius' death in 388, Theodosius replaced him with a moderate pagan who subsequently moved to protect the temples.[237][205][238]
