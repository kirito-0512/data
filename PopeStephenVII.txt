Pope Stephen VII (Latin: Stephanus VII; died 15 March 931)[1] was the bishop of Rome and nominal ruler of the Papal States from February 929 to his death in 931. A candidate of the infamous Marozia, his pontificate occurred during the period known as the Saeculum obscurum.
Stephen was a Roman[2] by birth, the son of Germanic (Goth) Theodemundus/Theudemund .[3] He was the cardinal-priest of St Anastasia in Rome. He was probably handpicked by Marozia, the true ruler of Rome during the Saeculum obscurum, to become pope as a stop-gap measure until her own son John was ready to assume the role.[3]
Very little is known about Stephen's pontificate. During his two years as pope, Stephen confirmed the privileges of a few religious houses in France and Italy.[3] As a reward for helping free Stephen from the oppression of Hugh of Arles, Stephen granted Cante di Gabrielli the position of papal governor of Gubbio, and control over a number of key fortresses.[4] Stephen was also noted for the severity with which he treated clergy who strayed in their morals.[5] He was also, apparently, according to a hostile Greek source from the twelfth century, the first pope who went around clean shaved whilst pope.[6]
Stephen died around 15 March 931, and was succeeded by Marozia's son John XI.
