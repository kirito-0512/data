Cubicfoot,
The cubic foot (symbol ft3 or cu ft)[1] is an imperial and US customary (non-metric) unit of volume, used in the United States and the United Kingdom. It is defined as the volume of a cube with sides of one foot (0.3048 m) in length. Its volume is 28.3168 L (about 1⁄35 of a cubic metre).
At 60 °F (15.6 °C), a cubic foot of water weighs 62.37 pounds (28.29 kg).
The IEEE symbol for the cubic foot is ft3.[1] The following abbreviations are used: cubic feet, cubic foot, cubic ft, cu feet, cu foot, cu ft, cu.ft, cuft, cb ft, cb.ft, cbft, cbf, feet3, foot3, ft3, feet/-3, foot/-3, ft/-3.[citation needed]
Larger multiples are in common usage in commerce and industry in the United States:
The IEEE symbol for the cubic foot per second is ft3/s.[1] The following other abbreviations are also sometimes used:
The flow or discharge of rivers, i.e., the volume of water passing a location per unit of time, is commonly expressed in units of cubic feet per second or cubic metres per second.
Cusec is a unit of flow rate,[2] used mostly in the United States in the context of water flow, particularly of rivers and canals.
Conversions: 1 ft3s−1 = 0.028316847 m3⋅s−1 = 28.316847 L⋅s−1 = 1.699 m3⋅min−1 = 1699 L⋅min−1
The IEEE symbol for the cubic foot per minute is ft3/min.[1] The following abbreviations are used:
Cubic feet per minute is used to measure the amount of air that is being delivered, and is a common metric used for carburettors,[3] pneumatic tools, and air-compressor systems.[4]
A standard cubic foot (abbreviated scf) is a measure of quantity of gas, sometimes[clarification needed] defined in terms of standard temperature and pressure as a cubic foot of volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 °C; 288.71 K) and 14.7 pounds per square inch (PSI) (1.01 bar; 101.35 kPa) of pressure.[citation needed]
