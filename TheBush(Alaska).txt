TheBush(Alaska),
In Alaska, the Bush typically refers to any region of the state that is not connected to the North American road network[1] or does not have ready access to the state's ferry system.  A large proportion of Alaska Native populations live in the Bush, often depending on subsistence hunting and fishing.[2][3]
Geographically, the Bush comprises the Alaska North Slope; Northwest Arctic; West, including the Baldwin and Seward Peninsulas; the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta; Southwest Alaska; Bristol Bay; Alaska Peninsula; and remote areas of the Alaska Panhandle and Interior. 
Some of the hub communities in the bush, which typically can be reached by larger, commercial airplanes, include Bethel,[2] Dillingham,[2] King Salmon,[2] Nome,[1][2] Utqiagvik,[1][2] Kodiak Island,[1] Kotzebue,[2] and Unalaska-Dutch Harbor.[2]
Most parts of Alaska that are off the road or ferry system can be reached by small bush airplanes.[1] Travel between smaller communities or to and from hub communities is typically accomplished by snowmobiles, boats, or ATVs.[2]
