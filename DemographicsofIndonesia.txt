DemographicsofIndonesia,
The population of Indonesia was 270.20 million according to the 2020 national census, an increase from 237.64 in 2010.[1][2] Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world. Approximately 55% of Indonesia's population resides on Java, which is the most populous island in the world.
Despite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967,[3] Indonesia's average population growth per year was over 1.1% for the decade ending in 2020, nearly having 13% population growth for that decade. At this rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the population of the United States if the population growth is not maintained.[4]
Indonesia has a relatively young population compared to Western nations, though it is aging as the country's birth rate has slowed and its life expectancy has increased. The median age was 30.2 years in 2017.[5]
Indonesia includes numerous ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important.

There are over 1,300 ethnic groups in Indonesia;[19] 95% of those are of Native Indonesian ancestry. Javanese is the largest group with 100 million people (42%), followed by Sundanese, who number nearly 40 million (15%).
Religion in Indonesia (2018)[20]
Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation; 86.7% of Indonesians declared themselves Muslim in the 2018 census.[21] 10.72% of the population adhered to Christianity (of which more than 70% were Protestant), 1.74% were Hindu, 0.77% Buddhist, and 0.07% of other faiths. Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese[22] and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are Chinese.[23]
Indonesian is the official language, but there are many different languages native to Indonesia. According to Ethnologue, there are currently 737 living languages spoken in Indonesia,[24] the most widely spoken being Javanese and Sundanese. In Western New Guinea, there are more than 270 indigenous languages in spoken form.[25][26] Some Chinese varieties, most prominently Min Nan, are also spoken. The public use of Chinese, especially usage of Chinese characters, was dissuaded officially between 1966 and 1998.[27]

Education is free in state schools; it is compulsory for children through to grade 12. Although about 92% of eligible children are enrolled in primary school, a much smaller percentage attend full-time. About 44% of secondary school-age children attend junior high school, and some others of this age group attend vocational schools.
