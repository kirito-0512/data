Malpractice,
In the law of torts, malpractice, also known as professional negligence,  is an "instance of negligence or incompetence on the part of a professional".[1]
Professionals who may become the subject of malpractice actions include:
Professional negligence actions require a professional relationship between the professional and the person claiming to have been injured by malpractice.[3] For example, in order to sue a lawyer for malpractice the person bringing the claim must have had an attorney-client relationship with the lawyer.[4]
To succeed in a malpractice action under typical malpractice law, the person making a malpractice claim must prove both that the professional committed an act of culpable negligence and that the person suffered injury as a result of the professional's error.[5]
Medical malpractice is a highly complex area of law, with laws that differ significantly between jurisdictions.[6]
In Australia, medical malpractice and the rise in incidences of claims against individual and institutional providers has led to the evolution of patient advocates.[7]
