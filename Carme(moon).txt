7188,
Carme(moon),
Carme /ˈkɑːrmiː/ is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory in California in July 1938.[1] It is named after the mythological Carme, mother by Zeus of Britomartis, a Cretan goddess.
Carme did not receive its present name until 1975;[9] before then, it was simply known as Jupiter XI. It was sometimes called "Pan"[10] between 1955 and 1975 (Pan is now the name of a satellite of Saturn).
It gives its name to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165°. Its orbital elements are as of January 2000.[11] They are continuously changing due to solar and planetary perturbations.
With a diameter of 46.7±0.9 km, it is the largest member of the Carme group and the fourth largest irregular moon of Jupiter.[6] It is light red in color (B−V=0.76, V−R=0.47), similar to D-type asteroids and consistent with Taygete, but not Kalyke.[12]
