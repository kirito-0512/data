This page is obsolete!
It is an archive of old feature requests that were still active on 2002 July 20, when we moved from Phase II to Phase III of the software.
Many requests were implemented then, while others became obsolete due to being rejected by the community.
See Wikipedia:Feature requests for current requests.
This is old. The current working document is Wikipedia:User interface ideas (see).
Requests for what goes on outside of the entries--the menubars up top and bottom, etc., user preferences.
