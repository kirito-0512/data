Telecommunications in Guatemala include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.
Guatemala's incumbent telephone company is TELGUA, which won the bidding for the privatization of the government run GUATEL.
In 2011 the OpenNet Initiative reported no evidence of Internet filtering in Guatemala.[8]
Guatemala's constitution protects freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and individual privacy, however, government officials routinely violate these rights. Recent constitutional reforms have legalized various electronic surveillance techniques that threaten online privacy.[8]
