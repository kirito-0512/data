Disjunctionelimination,
In propositional logic, disjunction elimination[1][2] (sometimes named proof by cases, case analysis, or or elimination), is the valid argument form and rule of inference that allows one to eliminate a disjunctive statement from a logical proof. It is the inference that  if a statement 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 implies a statement 



Q


{\displaystyle Q}

 and a statement 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 also implies 



Q


{\displaystyle Q}

, then if either 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 or 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is true, then 



Q


{\displaystyle Q}

 has to be true. The reasoning is simple: since at least one of the statements P and R is true, and since either of them would be sufficient to entail Q, Q is certainly true.
An example in English:
It is the rule can be stated as:
where the rule is that whenever instances of "



P
→
Q


{\displaystyle P\to Q}

", and "



R
→
Q


{\displaystyle R\to Q}

" and "



P
∨
R


{\displaystyle P\lor R}

" appear on lines of a proof, "



Q


{\displaystyle Q}

" can be placed on a subsequent line.
The disjunction elimination rule may be written in sequent notation:
where 



⊢


{\displaystyle \vdash }

 is a metalogical symbol meaning that 



Q


{\displaystyle Q}

 is a syntactic consequence of 



P
→
Q


{\displaystyle P\to Q}

, and 



R
→
Q


{\displaystyle R\to Q}

 and 



P
∨
R


{\displaystyle P\lor R}

 in some logical system;
and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:
where 



P


{\displaystyle P}

, 



Q


{\displaystyle Q}

, and 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 are propositions expressed in some formal system.
