She has two elder sisters and an elder brother.[8][9][10][11] She kindled an interest in dance at an early age of three, and went on to train in Kathak for eight years; later on becoming a professionally trained Kathak dancer.[12][13]
I received a scholarship as a Kathak dancer when I was nine. I even remember that it was due to a dance performance that the first time my name had appeared in the paper. I was seven or eight years old at that time and had performed at the Guru Purnima festival. And there was a journalist who was there and he had written this article saying that 'this little girl stole the show' – something like that. I was over the moon. So dance gave me a sense of achievement. Of worth."[14]Dixit received her education at Divine Child High School in Andheri. Apart from her studies, she participated in extra-curricular activities, such as dramatics.[15] Aspiring to become a microbiologist, Dixit enrolled at the Sathaye college in Vile Parle (Mumbai) where she studied microbiology as one of her subjects in BSc.[16] However, six months after she had commenced her course, Dixit decided to discontinue studies and pursue a full-time career in films.[17]
Dixit made her cinema debut in 1984 with Rajshri Productions' drama Abodh, opposite Bengali actor, Tapas Paul.[18] Upon release, the film failed commercially but Dixit's performance earned her positive reviews from critics. Aakash Barvalia of Gomolo wrote, "Madhuri excels in her role as a young bride who acquits herself well as the naive village girl and does not realise what marriage actually entails."[19]
Her only release of 1985 – Awara Baap – flopped at the box office.[20] During this time, a monochrome photograph of hers, shot by Gautam Rajadhyaksha was featured on the cover of the then popular magazine Debonair[21] and she appeared as the cover girl of Filmfare in April 1986.[22]

Chandra's action romance Tezaab opposite Anil Kapoor.[25] It went on to become the highest-grossing film of the year and she received her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination;[26] the film's success established Dixit as a leading actress of Hindi cinema, and marked a significant turning point in her career.[27] Akshay Shah of Planet Bollywood wrote, "Madhuri Dixit also gives a fine tuned performance. Though she is more remembered for her crowd pleasing dance act Ek Do Teen, her acting needs to be noted, specially in the scenes where she is pitted against Anupam Kher."[28]
Her first release of 1989, Vardi, did fairly well at the box office. She next re-united with Anil Kapoor for Subhash Ghai's Ram Lakhan. She played Radha Shastri, a girl who falls in love with her childhood friend, but finds it hard to convince her father.

A major critical success, the film was included in News18's 2013 list of the "100 greatest Indian films of all time".[31] It was selected as the official Indian submission for the 1990 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film but was not nominated.[32] Rediff.com opined that Dixit added "touching vulnerability and soft focus appeal to the heavy duty proceedings".[33] Also that year, after Prem Pratigyaa she starred in Ilaaka, Mujrim (both opposite Mithun Chakrobarty) and all three were hits. Other films such as Paap Ka Ant (opposite Govinda) and Kanoon Apna Apna (opposite Sanjay Dutt) was an average grosser.[34]

It emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year.[35] Rediff.com hailed her performance, commenting "..she showed her range as a performer. She breathed fire as the rebellious lover defying her family, or the forlorn estranged wife longing to be with her ailing better half."[33] Dixit's final release of the year was the action drama Thanedaar, opposite Dutt, which was another commercial hit.[35]
In 1991, Dixit had five film releases, the first of which was the romance Pyar Ka Devta. She next starred alongside Jackie Shroff in the psychological thriller 100 Days. She played Devi, a clairvoyant woman who has a vision of a murder and sets out to uncover the truth.

Zindagi Ek Juaa, Prem Deewane, Khel and Sangeet were her other releases of the year.

Her portrayal of Ganga, a police officer, who volunteers to go undercover, to trap an escaped criminal, garnered her critical acclaim. India Today wrote, "..she grinds and thrusts in her trademark dhak dhak style. The whistles grow deafening when she stares into the camera, looks at every man in the dark, and promises him her heart-and much more. In one Bangalore theatre, the police were kept on stand-by in case the crowds went berserk."[40] Dixit's performance in Khalnayak earned her a sixth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress and became the second highest-grossing film of the year in India.[26][41] Singeetam Srinivasa Rao's Phool and Lawrence D'Souza's Dil Tera Aashiq were her other releases of the year.

As she emotes through dance, you simply cannot take your eyes off her."[45] In a retrospect review, Rediff wrote, "Madhuri's Nisha was stunning, enthused, plucky and irresistible."[46] Film critic K Hariharan noted, "She is seducing every person on screen, but does it in ways that are so graceful, there is a good balance between profanity and the sacred."[47] The film won two National Award's, including the Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment[48] and in the Millennium Edition of the "Guinness Book of World Records", Hum Aapke Hain Kaun became Bollywood's highest-grossing film.[49]
Dixit achieved further success when she reunited with Indra Kumar for the romantic drama Raja opposite Sanjay Kapoor. She portrayed Madhu, a rich girl who falls for her childhood friend (played by Kapoor), however, she finds it tough to convince her two brothers of this relationship.

Simply dressed, she looks stunning and acts even better. She is by turns romantic, vulnerable, angry – the perfect foil to Azmi's long-suffering 'badi bahu'."[54] Screen magazine deemed her portrayal "fiery" and appreciated the lack of glamour in the part.[55] For her performance, Dixit won a third Screen Award for Best Actress.[56] She next starred in the dramas Koyla, Mahaanta and Mohabbat. With the exception of Koyla, none of these films performed well either critically or commercially.[57]

She next starred in the N.Chandra- directed drama Wajood (1998) opposite Nana Patekar and Mukul Dev. She played Apoorva, a very rich girl who is misunderstood by Malhar, played by Patekar. Suparn Verma of Rediff commented: "..She nevertheless shows that even a weak role cannot stifle her as she animates the screen like only she can. Truly, the coming together of Nana, Madhuri and Chandra in one film is a tour de force."[61] The same year, she appeared in a cameo role in the comedy Bade Miyan Chote Miyan, once again playing herself onscreen after Dharavi.[citation needed] Her next and only release of 1999 was the romance Aarzoo (1999) opposite Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan.

F. Husain. Hussain got fixated with Dixit, and watched her movie Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! several times, and was certain that he would make a film only with her.[67] The film followed the story of Gaja Gamini, who appears in various incarnations as Mona Lisa, Shakuntala and others.[68] Pukar was an average grosser, while the latter underperformed at the box office.[69][70]

Dealing with the issue of gender inequality, Dixit played Janki, a theatre actress who gets pre-maritally pregnant. Anita Bora of Rediff.com wrote: "Madhuri slips into her role as Janaki..with consummate ease..and..dazzles us with a class act."[74] The film was a box-office failure in India but was an overseas success.[73][75] Dixit's performance fetched her a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination and won her the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Female.[26][76] Dixit's first release of 2002 was the love triangle Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam opposite Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, where she played Radha whose married life blemishes when she gets obsessed with the career of her friend. A remake of director K. S. Adhiyaman's own Tamil film Thotta Chinungi (1995), the film took six years in making, with huge sabbaticals in between shoots due to several production problems.[77] The film emerged moderately successful at the Indian box office.[78] Few critics noted that the delay made the film look outdated.[79][80]
Dixit's next release was Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period romance Devdas, co-starring Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai. It was based on Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel of the same name.[81] She portrayed Chandramukhi, a courtesan who is in love with the title character.[82] Sita Menon of Rediff.com wrote: "The most understated role and perhaps the one that is most lingering, in terms of virtuosity, is that played by Madhuri Dixit. As Chandramukhi, she is simply stunning, lending passion, fire and gentleness with such consummate ease that watching her perform is sheer delight."[83][84] The film was screened at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was featured by Time in their listing of the "10 best films of the millennium".[85][86] The film emerged as a major commercial success with revenues of over ₹530 million (US$6.6 million).[87][88] Devdas was chosen as India's official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.[89] At the 50th National Film Awards, the film won five awards, including the Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment.[90] Dixit eventually won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film.[26][91] Post Devdas, Dixit took a break from actively working in films to focus on her married life in Denver, Colorado.

A box office failure, the film generated positive reviews for Dixit's portrayal.[95] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN criticised the plot, while he wrote about Dixit's performance: "It's hard to take your eyes off the screen when she's up there, dazzling you with her spontaneity, her easy charm and her 100-watt smile."[96] Her performance earned her another nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.[26]
Dixit relocated to India with her family in 2011 and was felicitated by Filmfare with a special jury recognition for completing 25 years in the Indian film industry.[97] In 2013, Dixit made a special appearance in the romantic comedy drama Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani as 'Mohini', a callback to her character from the 1988 film Tezaab.

Jha labelled Dixit's performance and demeanour "inconsistent".[111] However, Sampat Pal claimed that in Dixit's character she finds a "reflection of her own life so stark" that it makes her feel "it was she on screen".[112] The film was a box-office failure.[113]

Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote, "In the blinding glow of Dixit's presence as a nautch girl who can turn on the magic at will, the younger cast members pale somewhat in comparison.
