Magneticsail,
A magnetic sail is a proposed method of spacecraft propulsion that uses a static magnetic field to deflect a plasma wind of charged particles radiated by the Sun or a Star thereby transferring momentum to accelerate or decelerate a spacecraft.   Most approaches require little to no propellant and thus are a form of Field propulsion. A magnetic sail could also thrust against a planetary ionosphere or magnetosphere. Important use cases are: a modest force from the solar wind sustainable for a long period of time; deceleration in the interstellar medium and the plasma wind of a destination Star following interstellar travel at relativistic speeds achieved by some other means; and efficient deceleration in a planetary ionosphere.  Plasma characteristics for the Solar wind, a planetary ionosphere and the interstellar medium and the specifics of the magnetic sail design determine achievable performance; such as, thrust, required power and mass.
In January 1988, Louis Friedman published ''Star Sailing: Solar Sails and Interstellar Flight'', where he presented the concept of solar sailing and also talked about the possibility of using solar wind to propel a spacecraft.[1] A few months later, in October 1988, Dana Andrews and Robert Zubrin further developed the concept of magnetic sailing.[2][3] More magsail analysis were done for interplanetary in 1989,[4] planetary orbital propulsion in 1991[5] and a detailed design in 2000.[6] Freeland did further analysis in 2015 for Project Icarus that used a more accurate model of the magnetic field and showed that the Andrews and Zubrin results for drag (thrust) were optimistic by a factor of 3.1[7] In 2016 Gros published results[8] for magsail use for deceleration in the Interstellar medium. In 2017, Crowl documented an analysis[9] for a mission starting near the Sun and destined for Planet nine. Another mission profile for the magsail is heliocentric transfers, as described in 2013 by Quarta,[10] in 2019 by Bassetto,[11] and in 2020 by Perakis.[12]
A drawback of the magsail design was that a large (50–100 km radius) superconducting loop weighing on the order of 100 tonnes (100,000 kg) was required. In 2000, Winglee proposed a Mini-Magnetospheric Plasma Propulsion (M2P2) design that injected low energy plasma into a much smaller coil with much lower mass that required low power.[13] Simulations predicted impressive performance relative to mass and required power, a major factor being a claimed

 falloff rate of a magnetic dipole in a vacuum. A number of critiques raised issues: that the assumed magnetic field falloff rate was optimistic and that thrust was overestimated as well,[14]  an analysis indicating that predicted thrust was over ten orders of magnitude optimistic since the majority of the solar wind momentum was delivered to the magnetotail and current leakages through the magnetopause and not to the spacecraft,[15] and that conservation of magnetic flux in the region outside the magnetosphere was not considered.[16]
Starting in 2003 Funaki and others published a series of theoretical, simulation and experimental investigations at JAXA in collaboration with Japanese universities addressing some of the issues from criticisms of M2P2 and named their approach the MagnetoPlasma Sail (MPS).[17] In 2011 Funaki and Yamakawa authored a chapter in a book that is a good reference for magnetic sail theory and concepts.[18] MPS research resulted in many published papers that advanced the understanding of physical principles for magnetic sails. Results published in 2013 by Funaki and others found that best performance occurred when the injected plasma had a lower density and velocity than considered in M2P2 where ion drift created an equatorial ring current that augmented the magnetic moment of the coil, which simulations indicated achieved a thrust gain on the order of 10 for smaller magnetospheres as compared with an MHD modeled magnetic sail.[19][20] Investigations continued reporting increased thrust experimentally and numerically considering use of an Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (aka MPD Arc jet in Japan),[21]  multiple antenna coils,[22] and a multi-pole MPD thruster.[23]
John Slough of the University of Washington documented in 2004[24] and 2006[25] results of NASA Institute of Advanced Concepts (NIAC) funded research, development and experimentation for a more efficient method to generate the static magnetic dipole for a magnetic sail using a design called the Plasma magnet (PM). The design used a pair of small perpendicularly oriented coils powered by an alternating current to generate a Rotating magnetic field (RMF) operating a frequency too fast for positively charged ions to react, but slow enough to force electrons into co-rotation with the RMF without creating excessive collisions. This system created a large current disc composed of electrons captured from the plasma wind within a static disk of captured positive ions. The reports predicted substantial improvements in terms of reduced coil size (and hence mass) and markedly lower power requirements for significant thrust. An important factor in these predictions was a hypothesized 1/r magnetic field falloff rate as assumed for M2P2. In 2022 a spaceflight trial dubbed Jupiter Observing Velocity Experiment (JOVE) proposed using a Plasma magnet based sail for a spacecraft named Wind Rider using the solar wind to accelerate away from a point near Earth and decelerate against the magnetosphere of Jupiter.[26]
A 2012 study by Kirtley and Slough investigated using the plasma magnet technology to use the plasma in the ionosphere of a planetary as a braking mechanism and was called the Plasma Magnetoshell.[27] This paper restated the magnetic field falloff rate for a plasma magnet as 1/r2.  Kelly and Little in 2019[28] and 2021[29] published simulation results showing that the magnetoshell was more efficient than Aerocapture braking for orbital insertion around Neptune.
In 2021 Zhenyu Yang and others published an analysis, numerical calculations and experimental verification for a propulsion system that was a combination of the magnetic sail and the Electric sail called an electromagnetic sail.[30] A superconducting magsail coil augmented by an electron gun at the coil's center generates an electric field as in an electric sail that deflects positive ions in the plasma wind thereby providing additional thrust, which could reduce overall system mass.
Magnetic sail modes of operation cover the mission profile and environment usually involving plasma such as the solar wind, a planetary ionosphere or the interstellar medium. A plasma environment has fundamental parameters of the number of ions of type

A commonly encountered magnetic sail use case is creating drag against a plasma wind from a nearby star that accelerates a spacecraft away from the star. Many designs, analyses, simulations and experiments focus on this use case.[32] The solar wind is a time varying stream of plasma that flows outwards from the Sun. Near the Earth's orbit at 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) the plasma flows at velocity

 ranging from 250 to 750 km/s (155–404 mi/s) with a density ranging between 3 and 10 electrons, protons, and alpha particles per cm3 along with a few heavier ions per cubic centimeter.[33] Assuming that 8% of the solar wind is helium and the remainder hydrogen, the average solar wind plasma mass density at 1 AU is

A spacecraft accelerated to very high velocities by other means, such as a fusion rocket or laser pushed lightsail, can decelerate even from relativistic velocities – without requiring the use of onboard propellant by using a magnetic sail to create drag against the interstellar medium plasma environment.  For example. long duration missions, such as missions aimed to offer terrestrial life alternative evolutionary pathways, e.g. as envisioned by the Genesis project, could brake passively using magnetic sails on approach to a distant star.[36]
The Sun is the center of the heliosphere region that extends radially outwards to a termination shock at 75–90 AU, a heliosheath at 80 to 100 AU and then a theoretical heliopause at 120 AU. Beyond this is a relatively low density region called the Local Bubble which contains local interstellar cloud (which contains the Solar System) and a neighboring G-Cloud complex which contains Alpha Centauri. Less is known about the ISM than within the heliosphere, but measurements by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have provided important data and indirect observations have also provided information.
Estimates of the number of particles per cm3 are between 0.005 and 0.5 in the local bubble and G-cloud, respectively meaning that the ISM plasma mass density is

Radio emissions of cyclotron radiation due to interaction of charged particles in the interstellar medium as they spiral around the magnetic field lines of a magnetic sail would have a frequency of approximately (

Inside or near a planetary magnetosphere, a magnetic sail can thrust against or be attracted to a planet's magnetic field created by a dynamo, especially in an orbit that passes over the planet's magnetic poles.[5] When the magnetic sail and planet's magnetic field are in opposite directions an attractive force occurs and when the fields are in the same direction a repulsive force occurs, which is not stable and means to prevent the sail from flipping over is necessary.
The thrust that a magnetic sail delivers within a magnetosphere decreases with the fourth power of its distance from the planet's internal magnetic field. When close to a planet with a strong magnetosphere such as Earth or a gas giant, the magnetic sail could generate more thrust by interacting with the magnetosphere instead of the solar wind. When operating near a planetary or stellar magnetosphere the effect of that magnetic field must be considered if it is on the same order as the gravitational field.
By varying the magnetic sail's field strength and orientation a "perigee kick" can be achieved raising the altitude of the orbit's apogee higher and higher, until the magnetic sail is able to leave the planetary magnetosphere and catch the solar wind. The same process in reverse can be used to lower or circularize the apogee of a magsail's orbit when it arrives at a destination planet with a magnetic field.
In theory, it is possible for a magnetic sail to launch directly from the surface of a planet near one of its magnetic poles, repelling itself from the planet's magnetic field. However, this requires the magnetic sail to be maintained in its "unstable" orientation.  A launch from Earth required superconductors with 80 times the current density of the best known high-temperature superconductors as of 1991.[5]
In 2022 a spaceflight trial dubbed Jupiter Observing Velocity Experiment (JOVE) proposed using a plasma magnet to decelerate against the magnetosphere of Jupiter.[26]
Physical principles involved include:  interaction of magnetic fields with moving charged particles;  an artificial magnetosphere model analogous to the Earth's magnetosphere, MHD and kinematic mathematical models for interaction of an artificial magnetosphere with a plasma flow characterized by density and velocity, and performance measures; such as, force achieved, energy requirements and the mass of the magnetic sail system.

.  This means that the force on an ion or electron is proportional to the product of their charge q and velocity component

v

 perpendicular to the magnetic field B. A magnetic sail design introduces a magnetic field into a plasma flow which under certain conditions deflects the electrons and ions from their original trajectory with the particle's momentum transferred to the sail and hence the spacecraft thereby creating thrust.[32] An electric sail uses an electric field E that under certain conditions interact with charged particles to create thrust.
The characteristics of the Earth's magnetosphere have been widely studied as a basis for magnetic sails. The figure shows streamlines of charged particles from a plasma wind from the Sun (or a star) or an effective wind when decelerating in the ISM flowing from left to right. A source attached to a spacecraft generates a magnetic field. Under certain conditions at the boundary where magnetic pressure equals the plasma wind kinetic pressure an artificial magnetopause forms at a characteristic length 

L
L

 (m) from the field source. The ionized plasma wind particles create a current sheet, known as the Chapman–Ferraro current along the magnetopause, which compresses the magnetic field lines facing the oncoming plasma wind by a factor of 2 at magnetopause as shown in Figure 2a.[18] The magnetopause deflects charged particles, which affects their streamlines and increases the density at magnetopause. A magnetospheric bubble or cavity forms that has very low density downstream from the magnetopause. Upstream from the magnetopause  a bow shock develops. Simulation results often show the particle density through use of color with an example shown in the figure according to the legend in the lower left. This figure uses aspects of the general structure from Figure 3[4]  Figure 1[39] and Figure 2a,[18] and aspects of the plasma density from Figure 1,[14] and Figure 2.[40]
Magnetic sail designs operating in a plasma wind share a theoretical foundation based upon a  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, sometimes called a fluid model, from plasma physics for an artificially generated magnetosphere. Under certain conditions, the plasma wind and the magnetic sail are separated by a magnetopause that blocks the charged particles, which creates a drag force that transfers (at least some) momentum to the magnetic sail, which then applies thrust to the attached spacecraft.[41][16][18][39]
The figure depicts the MHD model.[18][32] Starting from the left a plasma wind in a plasma environment (e.g., stellar,  ISM or an ionosphere) of effective velocity

The spacecraft and field source generate a magnetic field that creates a magnetospheric bubble extending out to a magnetopause preceded by a bow shock that deflects electrons and ions from the plasma wind At magnetopause the field source magnetic pressure equals the kinetic pressure of the plasma wind at a standoff shown at the bottom of the figure.

In 2005 Nishida and others published results from numerical analysis of an MHD model for interaction of the solar wind with a magnetic field of current flowing in a coil that momentum is indeed transferred to the magnetic field produced by field source and hence to the spacecraft .[44] Thrust force derives from the momentum change of the solar wind, pressure by the solar wind on  the magnetopause from equation MHD.1 and Lorentz force from currents induced in the magnetosphere interacting with the field source. The results quantified the coefficient of drag, steering (i.e., thrust direction) angle with the solar wind, and torque generated as a function of attack angle (i.e., orientation) The figure illustrates how the attack (or coil tilt) angle 




α

t




{\displaystyle \alpha _{t}}

 orientation of the coil creates a steering angle for the thrust vector and also torque imparted to the coil. Also shown is the vector for the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), which at 1 AU varies with waves and other disturbances in the solar wind, known as space weather.[45]
For a coil with radial orientation (like a Frisbee) the attack angle 




α

{\displaystyle \alpha _{t}}

= 0 degrees and with axial orientation (like a parachute) 




α

Additional simulation results from Hajiwara15[49] are shown for the MHD and kinematic model as single data points as indicated in the legend. These models are all in close agreement. The kinematic models predict less force than predicted by the MHD model. In other words, the fraction

Important measures that determine the relative performance of different magnetic sail systems include: mass of the field source generator and its power and energy requirements; thrust achieved; thrust to weight ratio, any limitations and constraints, and propellant system exhausted, if any . Mass of the field source

The M2P2 and MPS designs, as well as potentially the plasma magnet design, exhaust some plasma as part of inflating the magnetospheric bubble and these cases also have a specific impulse and effective exhaust velocity performance measure.
The figure shows the magsail design[4] consisting of a loop of superconducting wire of radius

I

c


I_{c}

 (A) that generates a magnetic field, which was modeled according to the Biot–Savart law inside the loop and as a magnetic dipole far outside the loop. With respect to the plasma wind direction a magsail may have a radial (or normal) orientation or an axial orientation that can be adjusted to provide torque for steering.  In non-axial configurations lift is generated that can change the spacecraft's momentum. The loop connects via shroud lines (or tethers) to the spacecraft in the center. Because a loop carrying current is forced outwards towards a circular shape by its magnetic field, the sail could be deployed by unspooling the conductor wire and applying a current through it via the peripheral platforms.[6] The loop must be adequately attached to the spacecraft in order to transfer momentum from the plasma wind and would pull the spacecraft behind it as shown in the axial configuration in the right side of the figure.
Analysis of magsail performance was done using a simulation and a fluid (i.e., MHD) model with similar results observed for one case.[4] The magnetic moment of a current loop is

At a distance far from the loop center the magnetic field is approximately that produced by a magnetic dipole. Since the pressure at the magnetospheric boundary is doubled due to compression of the magnetic field and is the following at a point along the center-line axis at a distance

    (CMC.3)If operated within the solar system, high temperature superconducting wire (HTS) is necessary to make the magsail practical since the current required is large. However, protection from solar heating is necessary closer to the Sun, for example by highly reflective coatings.[51] If operated in interstellar space low temperature superconductors (LTS) could be adequate since the temperature of a vacuum is 2.7 K, but radiation and other heat sources from the spacecraft may render LTS impractical. The critical current carrying capacity of the promising HTS YBCO coated superconductor wire increases at lower temperatures with a current density

Results for another 4 solar wind cases were reported,[4] but the MHD applicability test of equation MHD.5 failed in these cases.

In a complete design, the mass of shielding the coil to maintain critical temperature and survive abrasion in outer space and other infrastructure must also be included. Appendix A estimates these as 90 tonnes for wire shielding and 50 tonnes for the spools and other magsail infrastructure. Freeland compared this magsail deceleration design with one where both acceleration and deceleration were performed by a fusion engine and reported that the mass of such a "dirty Icarus" design was over twice that with the magsail used for deceleration. An Icarus design published in 2020 used a Z-pinch fusion drive in an approach called Firefly that dramatically reduced mass of the fusion drive and made fusion only drive performance comparable to the fusion and magsail design.[52]

In 2017 Crowl documented a design for a mission starting near the Sun and destined for Planet nine approximately 1,000 AU distant[9] that employed the Magsail kinematic model. The design accounted for the Sun's gravity as well as the impact of elevated temperature on the superconducting coil, composed of meta-stable metallic hydrogen, which has a mass density of 3,500 (kg/m3) about half that of other superconductors. The mission profile used the Magsail to accelerate away from 0.25 to 1.0 AU from the Sun and then used the Magsail to brake against the Local ISM on approach to Planet nine for a total travel time of 29 years. Parameters and coil mass models differ from those used by Freeland.
Another mission profile uses a magsail oriented at an attack angle to achieve heliocentric transfer between planets moving away from or toward the Sun. In 2013 Quarta and others[10] used Kajimura 2012 simulation results[46] that described the lift (steering angle) and torque to achieve a Venus to Earth transfer orbit of 380 days with a coil radius of

In 2000 Winglee and others proposed a design order to reduce the size and weight of a magnetic sail and named it mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion (M2P2).[13] The figure based upon[13][53][54][19] illustrates the M2P2 design, which is the same as the Magneto plasma sail (MPS) design. Starting at the center with a solenoid coil of radius

 (A), which generates a magnetic field. The excited injected plasma enhances the magnetic field and generates a miniaturized magnetosphere around the spacecraft, analogous to the heliopause where the Sun injected plasma encounters the interstellar medium, coronal mass ejections or the Earth's magnetotail. The injected plasma created an environment that analysis and simulations showed had a magnetic field with a falloff rate of

 as compared with the classical model of a

 falloff rate, making the much smaller coil significantly more effective.[13][56] The pressure of the inflated plasma along with the stronger magnetic field pressure at a larger distance due to the lower falloff rate would stretch the magnetic field and inflate a magnetospheric bubble around the spacecraft.
The 2000 Winglee paper[13] described a design and reported results adapted from the Earth's magnetosphere. Parameters for the coil and solenoid were

R_{H}

=2.5 cm and for the coil

{\textstyle R_{c}}

= 0.1 m, 6 orders of magnitude less than the magsail coil with correspondingly much lower mass. An estimate for the weight of the coil was 10 kg and 40 kg for the plasma injection source and other infrastructure. Reported results from Figure 2 were

 is 173 km/s for 1 N of thrust force. Winglee assumed total propellant mass of 30 kg and therefore propellant would run out in 60 days.
In 2003, Khazanov published MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) and kinetic studies[14] that confirmed some aspects of M2P2 but raised issues that the sail size was too small, and that very small thrust would result and also concluded that the hypothesized

{\textstyle 1/r}

 magnetic field falloff rate was closer to

{\textstyle 1/r^{2}}

. The plasma density plots from Khazanov indicated a relatively high density inside the magnetospheric bubble as compared with the external solar wind region that differed significantly from those published by Winglee where the density inside the magnetospheric bubble was much less than outside in the external solar wind region.
A detailed analysis by Toivanen and others in 2004[39] compared a theoretical model of Magsail, dubbed Plasma-free  Magnetospheric Propulsion (PFMP) versus M2P2 and concluded that the thrust force predicted by Winglee and others was over ten orders of magnitude optimistic since the majority of the solar wind momentum was delivered to the magnetotail and current leakages through the magnetopause and not to the spacecraft.[15] Their comments also indicated that the magnetic field lines may not close near enough to the coil to achieve significant transfer of force. Their analysis made an analogy to the Heliospheric current sheet as an example in astrophysics where the magnetic field could falloff at a rate of between

 and

{\textstyle 1/r^{2}}

. They also analyzed current sheets reported by Winglee from the magnetopause to the spacecraft in the windward direction and a current sheet in the magnetotail. Their analysis indicated that the current sheets needed to pass extremely close to the spacecraft to impart significant force could generate significant heat and render this leverage impractical.
In 2005, Cattell and others [16] published comments regarding M2P2 that included a lack of magnetic flux conservation in the region outside the magnetosphere that was not considered in the Khazanov studies. Their analysis concluded in Table 1 that Winglee had significantly underestimated the required sail size, mass, required magnetic flux and asserted that the hypothesized

 magnetic field falloff rate was not possible.
The expansion of the magnetic field using injected plasma was demonstrated in a large vacuum chamber on Earth, but quantification of thrust was not part of the experiment.[57] The accompanying presentation has some good animations that illustrate physical principles described in the report.[58]  A 2004 Winglee paper primarily focused on usage of M2P2 for electromagnetic shielding.[59] Beginning in 2003, the Magneto plasma sail design further investigated the plasma injection augmentation of the magnetic field, used larger coils[42] and reported more modest gains.
In 2003 Funaki and others proposed an approach similar to the M2P2 design and called it the MagnetoPlasma Sail (MPS) that started with a coil

R_{c}

=0.2 m and a magnetic field falloff rate of

f_{o}

=1.52 with injected plasma creating an effective sail radius of

L

=26 km and assumed a conversion efficiency that transferred a fraction of the solar wind momentum to the spacecraft.[17][60] Simulation results indicated a significant increase in magnetosphere size with plasma injection as compared to the Magsail design, which had no plasma injection. Analysis showed how adjustment of the MPS steering angle created force that could reach the outer planets. A satellite trial was proposed. Preliminary performance results were reported but later modified in subsequent papers.
Many MPS papers have been published on the magnetic sail contributing to the understanding of general physical principles of an artificial magnetosphere, its magnetohydrodynamic model, and the design approach for computing the magnetopause distance for a given magnetic field source are documented in the linked sections of this article.
In 2004 Funaki and others analyzed MPS cases where

If

 then the Injection of a high-velocity, high-density plasma into a magnetosphere as proposed in M2P2 freezes the motion of a magnetic field into the plasma flow and was believed to inflate the magnetosphere.[14] However experiments and numerical analysis determined that the solar wind cannot compress the magnetosphere and momentum transfer to the spacecraft is limited since momentum is transferred to injected plasma flowing out of the magnetosphere,[19] similar to another criticism of M2P2.[39]
An alternative is to reduce the plasma injection velocity and density to result in

 to achieve a plasma in equilibrium with the inflated magnetic field and therefore induce an equatorial diamagnetic current in the same direction as the coil current as shown in the figure, thereby increasing the magnetic moment of the MPS field source and consequently increasing thrust. In 2013 Funaki and others[19][65] published simulation and theoretical results regarding how characteristics of the injected plasma affected thrust gain through creation of an equatorial ring current.

In 2014 Arita, Nishida and Funaki published simulation results[54] indicating that plasma injection created an equatorial ring current and that the plasma injection rate had a significant impact on thrust performance, with the lowest value simulated having the best performance of a thrust gain

In 2014 Ashida and others documented Particle In Cell (PIC) simulation results for a kinematic model for cases where

In 2017 Ueno published a design proposing use of multiple coils to generate a more complex magnetic field to increase thrust production.[69]  In 2020 Murayama and others published additional experimental results for a multi-pole MPD thruster.[23]
In 2020 Peng and others[70] published MHD simulation results for a magnetic dipole with plasma injection operating in Low Earth orbit at 500 km within the Earth's Ionosphere where the ion number density is approximately 1011 (m−3). As reported in Figure 3, the magnetic field strength initially falls off as 1/r and then approaches 1/r2 at larger distances from the dipole. The radius of the artificial mini-magnetosphere could extend up to 200 m for this scenario. They reported that the injected plasma reduced magnetic field fall off rate and created of a drift current, similar to earlier reported MPS results for the solar wind.[66]
The plasma magnet (PM) sail design introduced a different approach to generate a static magnetic dipole as illustrated in the figure.[24][25] As shown in the detailed view on the right the field source is two relatively small crossed perpendicularly oriented antenna coils each of radius

The figure illustrates rotation using color coded contours of constant magnetic strength, not magnetic field lines. In order to inflate the magnetospheric bubble the  thermal plasma beta 


β

\beta _{t}

 must be high and initially a plasma injection may be necessary, analogous to inflating a balloon when small and internal tension is high. After initial inflation, protons and rotating electrons are captured from the plasma wind through the leaky magnetopause and as shown in the left create a current disc shown as transparent red in the figure with darker shading indicating greatest density near the coil pair and extending out to the magnetopause radius Rmp, which is orders of magnitude larger than the coil radius Rc (figure not drawn to scale). See RMDCartoon.avi for an animation of this effect.[71] The induced current disc carries a direct current

Laboratory experiments[25] validated that the RMF creates a magnetospheric bubble, electron temperature near the coils increases and that thrust was generated. Since the scale of a terrestrial experiment is limited simulations or a flight trial was recommended. Some of these concepts adapted to an ionospheric plasma environment were carried on in the Magnetoshell magnetic design.
In 2022 Freeze, Greason and others[26] published a detailed design for a plasma magnet based sail for a spacecraft named Wind Rider that would use solar wind force to accelerate away from near Earth and decelerate against the magnetosphere of Jupiter in a spaceflight trial mission called Jupiter Observing Velocity Experiment (JOVE). This design employed a pair of superconducting coils each with radius

A 2012 study by Kirtley and Slough investigated the plasma magnet technology for use in the ionosphere of a planet as a braking mechanism in an approach dubbed plasma magnetoshell.[27] The magnetoshell creates drag by ionizing neutral atoms in a planet's ionosphere then magnetically deflecting them. A tether attaching the plasma magnet coils to the spacecraft transfers momentum such that orbital insertion occurs. Analytical models, laboratory demonstrations and mission profiles to Neptune and Mars were described.
In 2017 Kelly described using a single-coil magnet with 1/r3 magnetic field falloff rate and more experimental results.[73] In 2019 Kelly and Little published simulation results for magnetoshell performance scaling.[28]  A magnet with radius 


R

M

c


M_{c}

=1,000 kg and total magnetoshell system mass of 1,623 kg, suitable for a Cassini–Huygens or Juno size orbiter. The planet's mass and atmosphere atomic composition and density determine a threshold velocity where magnetoshell operation is feasible. Saturn and Neptune have a hydrogen atmosphere and a threshold velocity of approximately 22 km/s. In a Neptune mission a 


Δ
v

\Delta v

=6 km is required for a 5,000 kg spacecraft and must average 50 kN for the maneuver duration. The model overestimates performance for N2 (Earth, Titan) and CO2 (Venus, Mars) atmospheres since multiple ion species are created and more complex interactions occur. Furthermore, the relatively lower mass of Venus and Mars reduces the threshold velocity below that of feasible magnetoshell operation. The paper states that aerocapture technologies are mature enough for these mission profiles.
In 2021 Kelly and Little published further details[29] for use of drag-modulated plasma aerocapture (DMPA) that when compared to Adaptable Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT)[74] for drag-modulated aerocapture (DMA) to Neptune[75] that could deliver 70% higher orbiter mass and experience 30% lower stagnation heating.
A beam-powered of M2P2 variant, MagBeam was proposed in 2011.[76] In this design a magnetic sail is used with beam-powered propulsion, by using a high-power particle accelerator to fire a beam of charged particles at the spacecraft.[77] The magsail would deflect this beam, transferring momentum to the vehicle, that could provide higher acceleration than a solar sail driven by a laser, but a charged particle beam would disperse in a shorter distance than a laser due to the electrostatic repulsion of its component particles.  This dispersion problem could potentially be resolved by accelerating a stream of sails which then in turn transfer their momentum to a magsail vehicle, as proposed by Jordin Kare.[citation needed]

Designs with a superconducting coil do not require continuous power (but may require power for other functions, such as cooling); however, the plasma magnet design requires a continuous power source as specified in equation PM.3. An estimate for the plasma magnet power supply mass assumes ~3 kg/W for nuclear power in space. Other mass was assumed to be 10 tonnes for MS and 1 tonne of other mass for plasma magnet and MPS.

 performance occurs for the PM and MPS designs due primarily to much reduced coil and other mass. As described in the M2P2 section, several criticisms asserted that the falloff rate

Parameters for the other designs were chosen to yield comparable time performance subject to the constraints previously described. As described above and further detailed in the section for the respective design, this article contains the equations and parameters to compute performance estimates for different parameter choices.
In 1994 Vulpetti published a critical review regarding viability of space propulsion based on solar wind momentum flux.[78] The paper highlighted technology challenges in terms of the magnetic field source, energy required and interaction between the solar wind and the spacecraft's magnetic field, summarizing that these issues were not insurmountable. The major unresolved issue is spacecraft and mission design that account for the potentially highly variable solar wind velocity and plasma density that could complicate maneuvers by a spacecraft employing magnetic sail technology. Some means of modulating thrust is necessary. If the mission objective is to rapidly escape the solar system then the paper states that this is less of an issue.
In 2006 Bolonkin published a paper that questioned the theoretical viability of a Magsail and described common mistakes.[79] Equation (2) states that the magnetic field of electrons rotating in the large coil was greater than and opposed the magnetic field generated by the current in the coil and hence no thrust would result. In 2014 Vulpetti published a rebuttal[80] that summarized plasma properties, in particular the fact that plasma is quasi-neutral and noted in equation (B1) that the Bolonkin paper equation (2) assumed that the plasma had a large net negative electrical charge. The plasma charge varies statistically over short intervals and the maximum value has negligible impact on Magsail performance. Furthermore, he argued that observations by many spacecraft have observed compression of a magnetic field by dynamic (or ram) pressure that did not depend on particle charges.
In 2017, Gros published results that differed from prior magsail work.[8] A major result was the Magsail kinetic model of equation MKM.2 that is a curve fit to numerical analysis of proton trajectories impacted by a large current carrying superconducting coil. The curve fit scaling relation for the effective sail area

 of prior work.[4][7] The Gros paper could not trace back this difference to underlying physical arguments and noted that the results are inconsistent, stating that the source for these discrepancies was unclear. Appendix B questioned whether a bow shock will form if the initial spacecraft velocity

One advantage of magnetic or solar sails over (chemical or ion) reaction thrusters is that little to no reaction mass is depleted or carried in the craft. Acceleration or deceleration against a planetary magnetosphere is possible.
A disadvantage for interplanetary travel is that acceleration is only in the direction of a plasma wind away from the Sun or a star or deceleration in only in the direction opposite to the plasma wind from the Sun or a star. Only deceleration is possible in the interstellar medium.
Magnetic sails have become a popular trope in many works of science fiction although the solar sail is more popular: 
Although not referred to as a "magnetic sail", the concept was used in the novel Encounter with Tiber by Buzz Aldrin and John Barnes as a braking mechanism to decelerate starships from relativistic speed.
