Peter F. Hamilton (born 1960) is a British author. He is known for writing science fiction space opera.
Peter F. Hamilton was born in England in Rutland in 1960.[1] He did not attend university.  He said in an interview, "I did science at school up to age eighteen, I stopped doing English, English literature, writing at sixteen, I just wasn't interested in those days".[2]
After he started writing in 1987, he sold his first short story to Fear Magazine in 1988.[1] His first novel, Mindstar Rising, was published during 1993, followed by A Quantum Murder (1994) and The Nano Flower (1995), which together comprise the Greg Mandel trilogy.[2]
He then wrote a space opera novel, named The Night's Dawn Trilogy. He has also published the Commonwealth Saga with the Void Trilogy and The Chronicle of the Fallers in the same universe.[citation needed]
Since 2018, he has written the unrelated space opera Salvation Sequence, and young adult sci-fi Arkship Trilogy, set in original universes.[citation needed]
Hamilton received the Inkpot Award in 2012.[3]
