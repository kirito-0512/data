Government of Afghanistan,
The government of Afghanistan, officially called the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, is the central government of Afghanistan, a unitary state. Under the leadership of the Taliban, the government is a theocracy and an emirate with political power concentrated in the hands of a supreme leader and his clerical advisors, collectively referred to as the Leadership. The Leadership makes all major policy decisions behind closed doors, which are then implemented by the country's civil service and judiciary. As Afghanistan is an Islamic state, governance is based on Sharia, which the Taliban enforces strictly through extensive social and cultural policy.
Over its history, Afghanistan has variously been governed as a monarchy, a republic, and a theocracy. The current theocratic government came to power in 2021 with the Taliban's victory in a twenty-year insurgency against the western-backed Islamic Republic, after having itself been ousted in 2001.
The current government is internationally unrecognized and lacks a clear constitutional basis, though the Taliban has announced plans to form a constitutional commission in the near future. Instead, the government applies an arbitrary interpretation of Sharia. There is no separation of powers, with total authority vested in the Leadership.[1][2] The government is criticized by international observers for totalitarianism,[3] systemic human rights violations, as well as for being unaccountable, opaque, and exclusive of women, religious and ethnic minorities, and those with dissenting views. Since coming to power, it has grappled with an economic crisis, international isolation, terrorism and rebellion, and a string of natural disasters.
The supreme leader of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is the head-of-state, commander-in-chief, and religious leader of Afghanistan.[4] These responsibilities include appointing and dismissing the cabinet, judiciary, armed forces general staff,[5] and provincial and municipal governments, issuing decrees, special instructions, and orders regulating the operations of those mentioned above.[6][7][8][9][10][11] The supreme leader also approves or vetos laws drafted by cabinet ministries, after they are vetted by the Ministry of Justice and a review committee for compliance with Islamic law.[12] Supreme leaders have all served life terms, with their deputies appointed by the Leadership Council to succeed them. 
The supreme leader is advised by an advisory council of four to six individuals on appointments, national security, and domestic and religious policy, which form an advisory committee. These individuals have the final say on all policy decisions.[13]
The deputy leader(s) of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is the deputy head-of-state and is appointed by the supreme leader for an indefinite term. The deputy leader serves as acting top leader when the former is incapacitated or otherwise unavailable to execute their duties.[14] However, there can be more than two deputy leaders,[15][16] as was the case with Akhtar Mansoor promoting Haibatullah Akhundzada and Sirajuddin Haqqani to the positions. By norm, the first deputy leader succeeds the supreme leader upon death.
The Ulema Council of Kandahar, or Kandahar Provincial Council, is the de facto ruling and executive oversight body of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Despite being officially responsible for advising and overseeing the Kandahar provincial government, it also approves and disapproves all decisions made by the Kabul-based Council of Ministers.[17][13][18]

It is responsible for ensuring all policies by the executive conform to Sharia and can overrule decisions made by the Council of Ministers.[21] Other responsibilities include the appointment, removal or replacement, and giving of allegiance, to the Supreme Leader.[22][23]
The Central Dar ul-Ifta[24] is responsible for issuing fatwas on various issues.[25] It functions as a religious judicial body,[26] allowed to make quasi-binding decisions on multiple topics its scholars deem to be in line with Islamic Law.[18] Its director is appointed and dismissed by the supreme leader.

The deputy prime ministers of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan are the appointed deputy heads of government, responsible for presiding over the civil service and Council of Ministers in the prime minister's absence or incapacity.[30] Deputy prime ministers are also assigned specialized portfolios since 2021, overseeing technical commissions addressing critical issues.[31][32][33]
Like the prime minister and cabinet, the deputy prime ministers are appointed and dismissed by the supreme leader for an undefined term. 
The council of ministers of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is the cabinet. It comprises 26 ministries[34] whose agency executives administer the civil service and are overseen by the Prime Minister.[28] The ministries are also responsible for preparing legislation in their respective areas of policy for vetting by the Ministry of Justice and approval or veto by the supreme leader. Despite being led by the prime minister, it's effectively answerable and subordinate to the Supreme Leader.[35][36][37]
Several commissions have been formed to handle issues and subjects seen as critical by the Islamic Emirate. Several cabinet ministers or ministry directors are appointed to chair these commissions.[38] There are currently several commissions that have been formed since August 15, 2021.

Eight military courts serve as a court of the second instance for complaints, petitions, and lawsuits, involving personnel within the areas security forces from the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Interior Affairs, and General Directorate of Intelligence.

Beneath the provincial governor is departments that manage the local civil service. These departments are regional directorates of ministries within the council of ministers. Directors appointed and dismissed by the supreme leader oversee the operation of their respective local departments.[63] These departments at the provincial level are:
Internal and external security of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan are the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior Affairs and Ministry of Defence respectively.[79] The heads of these two respective ministries are Mohammed Yaqoob, head of the Military Affairs Commission within the Rahbari Shura and son of Mullah Omar, and Sirajuddin Haqqani, head of the Haqqani Network.[80]
