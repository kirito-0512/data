ForeignrelationsofSãoToméandPríncipe,
Until independence in 1975, São Tomé and Príncipe had few ties abroad except those that passed through Portugal. Following independence, the new government sought to expand its diplomatic relationships. A common language, tradition, and colonial legacy have led to close collaboration between São Tomé and other ex-Portuguese colonies in Africa, particularly Angola. São Toméan relations with other African countries in the region, such as Gabon and the Republic of the Congo, are also good. In December 2000, São Tomé signed the African Union treaty; it was later ratified by the National Assembly.
The São Toméan government has generally maintained a foreign policy based on nonalignment and cooperation with any country willing to assist in its economic development. In recent years, it has also increasingly emphasized ties to the United States and western Europe.

Prior to independence, the People's Republic of China (PRC) supported the country's indigenous movement for independence against the Portuguese Empire and the relationship continued after independence. Official diplomatic relation was established with the PRC upon independence on 12 July 1975. In 1975 and 1983, the country's first president, Manuel Pinto da Costa, visited the PRC. On 6 May 1997, São Tomé and Príncipe switched diplomatic relation from PRC to Republic of China (ROC).[20] On 15 November 2013, an unofficial PRC trade mission office was established in São Tomé and Príncipe to facilitate the non-political commercial ties with the PRC.[21] However, in June 2014, President Manuel Pinto da Costa made a private visit to Shanghai in Mainland China for a non-political mission.[22]
São Tomé and Príncipe had been speaking at the United Nations General Assembly for ROC meaningful participation in international organizations. While on the other side, ROC has provided various aids to the country for the development in their infrastructure and social system.[23]
São Tomé and Príncipe severed relations with ROC on 20 December 2016, leaving Burkina Faso and Swaziland as the only two remaining African nations retaining formal relations with the ROC,[24] when the ROC government reportedly turned down a São Toméan request for $210 million in financial assistance.[25] Diplomatic relations between PRC and São Tomé and Príncipe resumed on 26 December 2016.[26]
