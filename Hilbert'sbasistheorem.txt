Hilbert'sbasistheorem,

In mathematics, specifically commutative algebra, Hilbert's basis theorem says that a polynomial ring over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian.
If 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is a ring, let 



R
[
X
]


{\displaystyle R[X]}

 denote the ring of polynomials in the indeterminate 



X


{\displaystyle X}

 over 



R


{\displaystyle R}

. Hilbert proved that if 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is "not too large", in the sense that if 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is Noetherian, the same must be true for 



R
[
X
]


{\displaystyle R[X]}

. Formally,
Hilbert's Basis Theorem. If 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is a Noetherian ring, then 



R
[
X
]


{\displaystyle R[X]}

 is a Noetherian ring.[1]Corollary. If 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is a Noetherian ring, then 



R
[

X

1


,
…
,

X

n


]


{\displaystyle R[X_{1},\dotsc ,X_{n}]}

 is a Noetherian ring.This can be translated into algebraic geometry as follows: every algebraic set over a field can be described as the set of common roots of finitely many polynomial equations. Hilbert proved the theorem (for the special case of polynomial rings over a field) in the course of his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants.[2]
Hilbert produced an innovative proof by contradiction using mathematical induction; his method does not give an algorithm to produce the finitely many basis polynomials for a given ideal: it only shows that they must exist. One can determine basis polynomials using the method of Gröbner bases.
Theorem. If 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring, then the polynomial ring 



R
[
X
]


{\displaystyle R[X]}

 is also a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring.
Suppose 





a


⊆
R
[
X
]


{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a}}\subseteq R[X]}

 is a non-finitely generated left ideal. Then by recursion (using the axiom of dependent choice) there is a sequence of polynomials 



{

f

0


,

f

1


,
…
}


{\displaystyle \{f_{0},f_{1},\ldots \}}

 such that if 






b



n




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {b}}_{n}}

 is the left ideal generated by 




f

0


,
…
,

f

n
−
1




{\displaystyle f_{0},\ldots ,f_{n-1}}

 then 




f

n


∈


a


∖



b



n




{\displaystyle f_{n}\in {\mathfrak {a}}\setminus {\mathfrak {b}}_{n}}

 is of minimal degree. It is clear that 



{
deg
⁡
(

f

0


)
,
deg
⁡
(

f

1


)
,
…
}


{\displaystyle \{\deg(f_{0}),\deg(f_{1}),\ldots \}}

 is a non-decreasing sequence of natural numbers. Let 




a

n




{\displaystyle a_{n}}

 be the leading coefficient of 




f

n




{\displaystyle f_{n}}

 and let 





b




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {b}}}

 be the left ideal in 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 generated by 




a

0


,

a

1


,
…


{\displaystyle a_{0},a_{1},\ldots }

. Since 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 is Noetherian the chain of ideals
must terminate. Thus 





b


=
(

a

0


,
…
,

a

N
−
1


)


{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {b}}=(a_{0},\ldots ,a_{N-1})}

 for some integer 



N


{\displaystyle N}

. So in particular,
Now consider
whose leading term is equal to that of 




f

N




{\displaystyle f_{N}}

; moreover, 



g
∈



b



N




{\displaystyle g\in {\mathfrak {b}}_{N}}

. However, 




f

N


∉



b



N




{\displaystyle f_{N}\notin {\mathfrak {b}}_{N}}

, which means that 




f

N


−
g
∈


a


∖



b



N




{\displaystyle f_{N}-g\in {\mathfrak {a}}\setminus {\mathfrak {b}}_{N}}

 has degree less than 




f

N




{\displaystyle f_{N}}

, contradicting the minimality.
Let 





a


⊆
R
[
X
]


{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a}}\subseteq R[X]}

 be a left ideal. Let 





b




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {b}}}

 be the set of leading coefficients of members of 





a




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a}}}

. This is obviously a left ideal over 



R


{\displaystyle R}

, and so is finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of 





a




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a}}}

; say 




f

0


,
…
,

f

N
−
1




{\displaystyle f_{0},\ldots ,f_{N-1}}

. Let 



d


{\displaystyle d}

 be the maximum of the set 



{
deg
⁡
(

f

0


)
,
…
,
deg
⁡
(

f

N
−
1


)
}


{\displaystyle \{\deg(f_{0}),\ldots ,\deg(f_{N-1})\}}

, and let 






b



k




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {b}}_{k}}

 be the set of leading coefficients of members of 





a




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a}}}

, whose degree is 



≤
k


{\displaystyle \leq k}

. As before, the 






b



k




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {b}}_{k}}

 are left ideals over 



R


{\displaystyle R}

, and so are finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of 





a




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a}}}

, say
with degrees 



≤
k


{\displaystyle \leq k}

. Now let 






a



∗


⊆
R
[
X
]


{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a}}^{*}\subseteq R[X]}

 be the left ideal generated by:
We have 






a



∗


⊆


a




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a}}^{*}\subseteq {\mathfrak {a}}}

 and claim also 





a


⊆



a



∗




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a}}\subseteq {\mathfrak {a}}^{*}}

. Suppose for the sake of contradiction this is not so. Then let 



h
∈


a


∖



a



∗




{\displaystyle h\in {\mathfrak {a}}\setminus {\mathfrak {a}}^{*}}

 be of minimal degree, and denote its leading coefficient by 



a


{\displaystyle a}

.
Thus our claim holds, and 





a


=



a



∗




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a}}={\mathfrak {a}}^{*}}

 which is finitely generated.
Note that the only reason we had to split into two cases was to ensure that the powers of 



X


{\displaystyle X}

 multiplying the factors were non-negative in the constructions.
Let 



R


{\displaystyle R}

 be a Noetherian commutative ring. Hilbert's basis theorem has some immediate corollaries.
Formal proofs of Hilbert's basis theorem have been verified through the Mizar project (see HILBASIS file) and  Lean (see ring_theory.polynomial).
