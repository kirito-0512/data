NATO has a system of reporting names for non-Western submarines. During the Cold War, NATO introduced a system of internal code names for classes of Soviet and Chinese submarines. This served to provide standard names where the official designation of a Soviet/Chinese designations of vessels were unknown. The system was influenced by a pre-existing, separate system for reporting non-Western aircraft.
Until the 1980s, reporting names for submarines were taken from the NATO spelling alphabet. Modifications of existing designs were given descriptive terms, such as "Whiskey Long Bin". From the 1980s onwards, new designs were given names derived from Russian words, such as "Akula" ("Shark"). These names did not correspond to the Soviet names. Coincidentally, "Akula", which was assigned to an attack submarine by NATO, was the actual Soviet name for another, ballistic missile submarine class, which NATO designated "Typhoon". 
The names for Chinese submarines are taken from Chinese dynasties.
The code names are followed by official Soviet Navy/Russian Navy designations.
