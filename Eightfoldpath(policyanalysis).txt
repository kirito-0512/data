Eightfoldpath(policyanalysis),

The eightfold path is a method of policy analysis assembled by Eugene Bardach, a professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.[1] It is outlined in his book A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving, which is now in its sixth edition.[2] The book is commonly referenced in public policy and public administration scholarship.[3]
Bardach's procedure is as follows:
A possible ninth step, based on Bardach's own writing, might be "repeat steps 1â€“8 as necessary."
The method is named after the Buddhist Noble Eightfold Path, but otherwise has no relation to it.
The New York taxi driver test is a technique for evaluating the effectiveness of communication between policy makers and analysts. Bardach contends that policy explanations must be clear and down-to-earth enough for a taxi driver to be able to understand the premise during a trip through city streets. The New York taxi driver is presumed to be both a non-specialist and a tough customer.[4][5]
