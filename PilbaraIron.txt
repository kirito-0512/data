Pilbara Iron is a wholly owned subsidiary of the multinational Rio Tinto Group, that manages assets for Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, and Robe River Iron Associates, an unincorporated joint venture between Rio (53% and operator since 2000) and three Japanese steel companies Mitsui Iron Ore Development P/L (33%), Nippon Steel Australia P/L (10.5%) and Sumitomo Metal Australia P/L (3.5%).[1]
All of these companies are involved in the mining of iron ore, predominantly from the Pilbara region of Western Australia.
In 2004, Rio Tinto announced that Robe and Hamersley would start merging operations under the new Pilbara Iron entity.[2] The concept had been tested by the formation of Pilbara Rail in 2001, which generated more than $16 million in savings. Pilbara Rail was folded into Pilbara Iron in 2005.[3] Each company continues to market products separately and retains ownership and profits from the underlying mines, as well as strategic development of their own mineral resources.[4]
Mine sites currently operating:
All iron ore mined at the sites is transported on the Hamersley & Robe River railway, one of the world's largest privately owned railroads to either the port of Dampier, Western Australia or Cape Lambert near Wickham, Western Australia. From there the ore is shipped across the world, with China and Japan the largest markets as of 2007.[5]

February 1964: a proposal is announced for Hamersley Iron to export 65 million tons over 15 years starting in 1967 to the Japanese steel industry. Reserves estimated at 5 billion tons of 50% to 66% by Kaiser Steel. Ten involved Japanese steel works cited in the Iron Age article.[6]

(joint venture of Cyprus Mines Corp of Los Angeles, Utah Construction & Mining Co. of San Francisco, Consolidated Gold Fields, Ltd. of London) signed a $164,000,000 contract for 16.5 million tons of Western Australia ore with Japanese buyers. Also a $60 million contract for pellets from Tasmania to Japan is signed at the time.[12] Reported as a 82 million tons, $757 million over 17 year contract by International Commerce.[11]
