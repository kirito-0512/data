Roll-your-owncigarette,

A roll-your-own (RYO) cigarette, also called a handrolled cigarette, is a cigarette made from loose tobacco (usually a shag cut) and rolling paper. Factory-made cigarettes are called industrial cigarettes.
Rolling tobacco, or cigarette tobacco, is the primary tobacco used for RYO cigarettes. It is generally packaged in pouches.[1]
After 2009, the United States federal tax rate on RYO tobacco was raised from $1.0969 per pound to $24.78 per pound.[2]  This increase has caused many people to switch to using pipe tobacco to make cigarettes, since the pipe tobacco tax rate was also increased, but only to $2.83 per pound.[3]
In Australia, loose tobacco was taxed less than manufactured cigarettes until September 2016.[4]
RYO has become more popular in the United States in recent years, but relatively few smokers, only 6.7%, actually roll their own cigarettes.[citation needed] In contrast, this rate was 15% in Canada, 22% in Australia, and 30% in the UK.[5] Reasons for this difference include the generally lower price of traditional cigarettes in most states in the US compared to Canada and Europe.[citation needed]
