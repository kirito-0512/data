AndhraPradesh,
Andhra Pradesh (English: /ˌɑːndrə prəˈdɛʃ/,[6] Telugu: [aːndʱrɐ prɐdeːʃ] (listen) abbr. AP) is a state in the southern coastal region of India. It is the seventh-largest state with an area of 162,970 km2 (62,920 sq mi)[2] and tenth-most-populous state, with 49,577,103 inhabitants.[1] It has shared borders with Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and the Bay of Bengal. It has the second-longest coastline in India of about 974 km (605 mi).[2] After existence as Andhra state and unified Andhra Pradesh, the state took its present form on 2 June 2014, when the new state Telangana was formed through bifurcation.[7] Amaravati serves as the capital of the state with the largest city being Visakhapatnam. Water sharing disputes and assets division with Telangana are not yet resolved. Telugu, one of the classical languages of India used by majority of people, is an official language.
As per the 8th century BCE Rigvedic text Aitareya Brahmana, the Andhras left North India from the banks of the Yamuna river and migrated to South India. In the third century BCE, Andhra was a vassal kingdom of Ashoka of Mauryan Empire. After his death, it became powerful and extended its empire to the whole of Maratha country and beyond under the rule of Satavahana dynasty. After that, the major rulers included Pallavas, Eastern Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara empire, Qutb Shahi dynasty, Nizam dynasty, East India Company, and British Raj.
The Eastern Ghats are a major dividing line separating coastal plains and peneplains. The coastal plains are part of Coastal Andhra. These mostly are delta regions formed by the Krishna, Godavari, and Penna rivers. Peneplains are part of Rayaaseema. 60% of the population is engaged in agriculture and related activities. Rice is the major food crop and staple food of the state. The state contributes 10% of total fish and over 70% of the shrimp production of India. Industry sectors such as food products, non-metallic minerals, textiles and pharmaceuticals are the top employement providers. Automotive sector accounts for 10% of auto exports of India. The state has about one-third of India's limestone reserves, large deposits of baryte and galaxy granite, apart from reserves of oil and natural gas.[8] Satish Dhawan Space Centre(SDSC), known as Sriharikota Range (SHAR), at barrier island of Sriharikota in Tirupati district is the satellite launching station of India.
Some of the unique products from the state are Banaganapalle mangoes, Bandar laddu, Kondaplli toys, Tirupati laddu, and saris made in Dharmavaram and Machilipatnam. Kuchipudi is the official dance form. Many composers of Carnatic music like Annamacharya, Kshetrayya, Tyagaraja, and Bhadrachala Ramadas were from this region. The Tirumala Venkateswara temple near Tirupati is the most visited Hindu religious place in the world. The state is home to a variety of other pilgrimage centres and natural attractions.
According to Sanskrit text Aitareya Brahmana (800–500 BCE), a group of people named Andhras left North India from banks of River Yamuna and settled in South India.[9][10][11] The Satavahanas were mentioned by names Andhra, Andhrara-jateeya, and Andhrabhrtya in the Puranic literature.[12][13] They did not refer to themselves as Andhra in any of their coins or inscriptions; it is possible that they were termed as Andhras because of their ethnicity or because their territory included the Andhra region.[14][15]

The Assaka mahajanapada, one of the sixteen Vedic mahajanapadas, included Andhra, Maharashtra and Telangana.[16] Archaeological evidence from places such as Bhattiprolu, Amaravati, Dharanikota, and Vaddamanu suggests that the Andhra region was part of the Mauryan empire. Amaravati might have been a regional centre for the Mauryan rule. After the death of Emperor Ashoka, Mauryan rule weakened around 200 BCE and was replaced by several smaller kingdoms in the Andhra region.[17] One of the earliest evidence of Brahmi script, the progenitor of several scripts including Telugu comes from Bhattiprolu where the script was used on an urn containing the relics of Buddha.[18]
The Satavahana dynasty dominated the Deccan plateau from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE.[19] It had trade relations with Roman empire.[20] The later Satavahanas made Dharanikota near Amaravati their capital. According to the Buddhists, Nagarjuna, the philosopher of Mahayana lived in this region.[21][22][23] The Andhra Ikshvakus, with their capital at Vijayapuri, succeeded the Satavahanas in the Krishna River valley in the latter half of the 2nd century.[24] The Salankayanas were an ancient dynasty that ruled the Andhra region between Godavari and Krishna with their capital at Vengi (modern Pedavegi) from 300 to 440 CE.[25] Telugu Cholas ruled present day Rayalaseema from the fifth to the eleventh centuries from Cuddapa and Jammalamadugu. The Telugu inscription of Erikal Mutturaju Dhananjaya Varma, known as Erragudipadu sasanam, was engraved in the 575 A.D. in the present Kadapa district. It is the earliest written record in Telugu language.[26]
The Vishnukundinas were the first dynasty in the fifth and sixth centuries, that held sway over most of Andhra, Kalinga,and parts of Telangana.[27] The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, whose dynasty lasted for around five hundred years from the 7th century until 1130 CE, eventually merged with the Chola dynasty. They continued to rule under the protection of the Chola dynasty until 1189 CE [28] At the request of King Rajaraja Narendra, Nannaya considered as the first Telugu poet, took up the translation of Mahabharata into Telugu in 1025 CE.[29]
Kakatiyas ruled this region and Telangana for nearly two hundred years between 12th and 14th centuries. They were defeated by Delhi Sultanate. Musunuri Nayaks and Bahamani sultanate took over when Delhi Sultanate became weak. The Reddi kingdom ruled parts of this region in the early 14th century. They constructed Kondaveedu fort and Kondapalli forts. After their rule, Gajpathis and Bahmani sultans ruled this region in succession before this region along with most of the present day Andhra Pradesh became part of the Vijayanagar empire.[30][31][32]
The Vijayanagara empire originated in the Deccan plateau in the early 14th century. It was established in 1336 by Harihara Raya I and his brother Bukka Raya I of the Sangama dynasty who served as treasury officers of the Kakatiyas of Warangal.[33] During their rule, the Pemmasani Nayaks controlled parts of Andhra Pradesh and had large mercenary armies that were the vanguard of the empire in the 16th century.[34] The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form.[35] The Lepakshi group of monuments built during this period have mural paintings of the Vijayanagara kings, Dravidian art, and inscriptions.[36] These are put on the tentative list of UNESCO world heritage committee.[37]
Following the defeat of Vijayanagara empire, the Qutb Shahi dynasty held sway over the Andhra country.[38] This region passed into rule of Nizams under Mughal empire. Soon Nizam established himself as the sovereign ruler. In 1611, English trading post by the name "East India Company" was established in Masulipatinam on India's east coast.[39] In the early nineteenth century, Northern Circars was ceded to the British East India Company and became part of its Madras Presidency. Eventually, this region emerged as the Coastal Andhra region, northern parts of which were later known as Uttarandhra. Later the Nizam ceded five territories to the British that eventually became the Rayalaseema region. The local chieftains known as Poligars revolted in 1800 against the company rule, which was suppressed by the company.[40]
Raja Viziaram Raz (Vijayaram Raj) established a sovereign kingdom by claiming independence from the Kingdom of Jeypore in 1711. It formed alliances with the French and British East India Company to conquer the neighbouring principalities of Bobbili, Kurupam, Paralakhemundi, and the kingdom of Jeypore. It fell out with the British and as a result was attacked and defeated in the battle of Padmanabham. It was annexed as a tributary estate like other principalities and remained so until their accession to the Indian Union in 1949.[41]
Following the Indian rebellion of 1857, British crown ruled this region, till India became independent in 1947. No Tax campaign in Chirala and Perala in 1919 led by Duggirala Gopalakrishnayya, Rampa Revolt led by Alluri Sitarama Raju in 1921, Salt satyagraha in Dendulur in 1930 are some of the protests against the British rule.[40] Tanguturi Prakasam was arrested and jailed for more than three years for participating in the Quit India movement of 1942. He served as prime minister of Madras presidency in 1946-47.[42]
Dowleswaram Barrage, built in 1850 by Arthur Cotton brought unused lands in the Godavari river basin into cultivation and transformed the economy of the region.[43] Charles Philip Brown did pioneering work in transforming Telugu to the print era and introduced Vemana poems to English readers.[44] Kandukuri Veeresalingam is considered as the father of the Telugu renaissance movement as he encouraged the education of women and the remarriage of widows and fought against child marriage and the dowry system.[45] Gurajada Apparao, a pioneering playwright who used spoken dialect wrote the play Kanyasulkam in 1892. It is considered as the greatest play in the Telugu language.[46]

In an effort to gain an independent state based on linguistic identity and to protect the interests of the Telugu-speaking people of Madras state, Potti Sreeramulu fasted to death in 1952. As Madras city became a bone of contention, in 1949 a committee with Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, and Pattabhi Sitaramayya was constituted. The committee recommended that Andhra province could be formed provided the Andhras gave up their claim on the city of Madras [now Chennai]. After Potti Sreeramulu's death, the Telugu-speaking area of Andhra state was carved out of Madras state on 1 October 1953, with Kurnool as its capital city. Tanguturi Prakasam became the first chief minister. On the basis of the Gentlemen's agreement of 1956, the States reorganisation act created Andhra Pradesh by merging the neighbouring Telugu-speaking areas of the Hyderabad State with Hyderabad as the capital on 1 November 1956.[47]
The Indian National Congress (INC), ruled the state from 1956 to 1982. Neelam Sanjiva Reddy became the first chief minister. Among other chief ministers, P. V. Narasimha Rao is known for implementing land reforms and land ceiling acts and securing reservation for lower castes in politics.[48] Nagarjuna Sagar Dam completed in 1967 and Srisailam Dam
completed in 1981 are some of the irrigation projects, which helped in increased production of paddy in the state.[49]
In 1983, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) won the state elections and N. T. Rama Rao became the chief minister of the state for the first time after launching his party just nine months earlier.[50] This broke the long-time single party monopoly enjoyed by the INC. He transformed the sub-district administration by forming mandals in place of earlier taluks and removing hereditary village heads and appointing non-hereditary village revenue assistants.[51] 
The 1989 elections ended the rule of Rao, with the INC returning to power with Marri Chenna Reddy at the helm. In 1994, Andhra Pradesh gave a mandate to the Telugu Desam Party again and Rao became the chief minister again. Nara Chandrababu Naidu, Rao's son-in-law, came to power in 1995 with the backing of a majority of the MLAs. The Telugu Desam Party won both the assembly and Lok Sabha election in 1999 under the leadership of Chandrababu Naidu. Thus Naidu held the record for the longest-serving chief minister (1995 to 2004) of united Andhra Pradesh.[52] He introduced e-governance by launching e-Seva centers in 2001 for paperless and speedy delivery of government services. He is credited with transforming Hyderabad into an IT hub, by providing incentives for tech companies to setup centers.[53]
In 2004, Congress returned to power with a new chief ministerial face, YS Rajashekara Reddy, better known as YSR. The main emphasis during Reddy's tenure was on social welfare schemes such as free electricity for farmers, health insurance, tuition fee reimbursement for poor, and national   rural employment guarantee scheme. He took over the free emergency ambulance service initiated by a corporate and ran it as a government project. INC won the 2009 elections under the leadership of YSR in April.[54] He was elected chief minister again, but was killed in a helicopter crash that occurred in September 2009. He was succeeded by Congressmen Konijeti Rosaiah and Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy, the latter resigned over the impending division of state to form Telangana.[55]
During 58 years as unified state, the state weathered separatist movements from Telangana (1969) and Andhra (1972) successfully.[56] A new party called Telangana Rashtra Samithi was formed in April 2001 by Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) reignited the Telanganga movement. Joint action committee formed with political parties, government employees, and general public spearheaded the agitation. When KCR 's health deterirorated by his fast unto death program, the central government decided to initiate the process to form independent Telangana in December 2009. This triggered Samaikyandhra movement to keep the state united. Srikrishna committee was formed to give recommendations to deal with the situation. It gave its report in December 2010[57] The agitations continued for nearly 5 years with Telangana side harping on marginalisation of food culture, language, and an unequal economic development and Samaikyandhra movement focusing on shared culture, language, customs and historical unity of Telugu speaking regions.[58] The Andhra Pradesh reorganisation act bill was passed by the parliament of India for the formation of the Telangana state comprising ten districts, despite opposition by the state legislature.[59] The bill included the provision to retain Hyderabad as capital for up to ten years and included the provision to ensure access to the educational institutions for the same period.[7] The bill received the assent of the president and was published in the gazette on 1 March 2014.[60]  The new state of Telangana came into existence on 2 June 2014 after approval from the president of India, with the residual state continuing as Andhra Pradesh.[61] The present form of Andhra Pradesh is same as Andhra state, except Bhadrachalam town which continues in Telangana.[62] Number of petitions questioning the validity of Andhra Pradesh reorganisation act, 2014 are pending before the Supreme Court constitutional bench since April 2014.[63]
In the final elections held in the unified state in 2014, the TDP got a mandate in its favour, defeating its nearest rival YSR Congress Party, a break away faction of the Congress founded by Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, son of former Chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy. N. Chandrababu Naidu, the chief of the TDP became the chief minister on 8 June 2014.[64] In 2017, Government of Andhra Pradesh began operating from its new greenfield capital Amaravati for which 33,000 acres were acquired from farmers through an innovative land pooling scheme.[65][66] Interstate issues with Telangana relating to division of assets of public sector institutions and organisations of the united state and division of river waters are not yet resolved.[67][68]

In August 2020, Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly passed Andhra Pradesh decentralisation and inclusive development of all regions act. It provided for limiting Amaravati as legislative capital, while naming Vizag as executive capital and Kurnool as judicial capital.[124] The events leading to this decision resulted in widespread continuing protests by the farmers of Amaravati.[125] The act has been challenged in Andhra Pradesh High Court, which ordered to maintain status quo until the court completes its hearing. The government, led by Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, withdrew the act, when the High Court hearing reached the final stage. The chief minister said that his government would bring a better and more complete bill.[126] The protesters under the banner of Amaravati parirakshana samithi (APS) and joint action committee (JAC) of Amaravati received support from all the political parties barring the ruling YCP when they held their long marches across the state seeking support for their agitation.[127]
On 5 March 2022, High Court ruled that the government could not abandon development of Amaravati as capital city after farmers parted with 33,000 acres of land against the agreement with Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) to develop it as the capital city and ₹15,000 crore was sunk in it over development expenditure.

Andhra Pradesh and Telangana continue to dispute water share of the Krishna river. In 1969, the Bachawat tribunal for allocation of water share among the riparian stats allocated 811 tmcft water to Andhra Pradesh. The Andhra Pradesh government of that time split it in 512:299 tmcft ratio between Andhra (including the basin area of Rayalaseema) and Telangana respectively. It was based on the utilisation facilities established at that time. Though tribunal recommended utilisation of the Tungabhadra Dam (a part of the Krishna Basin) water to the drought-prone Mahabubnagar area of Telangana, this was not implemented. The bifurcation act advised the formation of the Krishna river management board (KRMB) and the Godavari river management board (GRMB) for resolving the disputes between the new states. In 2015, the two states agreed to share water in the 66:34 (AP:Telangana) ratio as an interim arrangement in a meeting with central water ministry, which is to be reviewed every year. This practice continued without further review. Telangana state filed a suit in Supreme Court for 70% share. Following the assurance of formation of tribunal to resolve the issue, Telangana withdrew its suit. Center is yet to form the tribunal.[68]
