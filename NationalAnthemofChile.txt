The "National Anthem of Chile" (Spanish: Himno Nacional de Chile, pronounced [ˈimno nasjoˈnal de ˈtʃile]), also known as "Canción Nacional" ([kanˈsjon nasjoˈnal]; transl. "National Song") or by its incipit "Puro, Chile, es tu cielo azulado" ('How pure, Chile, is your blue sky')[citation needed], was adopted in 1828. It has a history of two lyrics and two melodies that made up three different versions. The current version was composed by Ramón Carnicer, with words by Eusebio Lillo, and has six parts plus the chorus.
The first Chilean national anthem dates back to 1819, when the government called for, on 13 January, the creation of music and lyrics for this purpose.
The composer Manuel Robles and the poet Bernardo de Vera y Pintado fulfilled this mandate and their "National Song" debuted on 20 August 1820 in the Domingo Arteaga theater, although other historians claim that it was played and sung during the festivities of September 1819.
In the beginning, everyone would stand for the song. The custom of always singing it at the theater slowly disappeared, until it was requested that it only be sung at the anniversary of the country.
The doctor Bernardo Vera, known in the history of the independence, was the author of the verses that were sung to Robles' music.
This first hymn was sung until 1828, when it was replaced with what is sung today.
The second and current Chilean national anthem was composed by the Spanish composer Ramón Carnicer, when he was exiled in England because of his liberal ideas. Mariano Egaña, Chilean Minister in London, acting on the criticism that Robles' song was receiving, asked Carnicer to compose a new hymn with Bernardo de Vera's original text.
The Spanish musician probably wrote the work by 1827, the date he returned to Barcelona, and his hymn debuted in Santiago, in the Arteaga theater, 23 December 1828.
Years later, in 1847, the Chilean government entrusted the young poet Eusebio Lillo with a new text that would replace the anti-Spain poem of Vera y Pintado, and after being analyzed by Andrés Bello, retained the original chorus ("Dulce patria, recibe los votos..."). The lyrics were slightly revised in 1909.
During the military dictatorship (1973–1990) of Augusto Pinochet, the Verse III was officially incorporated because of his praise of the armed forces and the national police (Carabineros). After the end of Pinochet's regime, in 1990, it was only sung in military events. Supporters from the former military junta also sing the anthem with the Verse III in private ceremonies and rallies, with continuous controversies over the following years because of the crescent general consensus of the crimes against humanity committed by the regime.
In the celebrations marking the return of democracy in March 1990 at Santiago's Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos, the anthem was played in its present melody, raised to F Major (the Royal Musical Official Version of the anthem) which is the original melody of the second anthem by Carnicer, but using the 1847 lyrics as text, save for the original chorus of the 1819 anthem. This was the version that from 1991 to 2000 was played before broadcasts of Chilean presidential addresses. In 2000, it was replaced by a more stylized version, which was used until 2010. After that, the anthem was scrapped off the addresses. Since the end of the dictatorship, television stations rarely ever used the anthem during their sign-on and sign-off, and the practice fell off definitely during the 1990s. Radio stations in Chile still have a tradition to play the anthem in New Year's Eve, in order to start celebrations[citation needed]. 
Joe Walsh, famed musician who was part of the United States rock band the Eagles, sang the National Anthem of Chile at a Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim baseball game in 2003.[1]
There is also a translation in Mapudungun,[2] the largest and most-commonly spoken indigenous language in Chile, spoken by the Mapuche people.
Below are the lyrics of the most played version; it corresponds to verse V of the full version and the chorus.[3][4]
Puro, Chile, es tu cielo azulado.
Puras brisas te cruzan también.
Y tu campo de flores bordado
Es la copia feliz del Edén.
Majestuosa es la blanca montaña
𝄆 Que te dio por baluarte el Señor, 𝄇
𝄆 Y ese mar que tranquilo te baña
Te promete futuro esplendor. 𝄇

Coro:
Dulce Patria, recibe los votos
Con que Chile en tus aras juró:
𝄆 Que o la tumba serás de los libres
O el asilo contra la opresión 𝄇
Que o la tumba serás de los libres
O el asilo contra la opresión
O el asilo contra la opresión
O el asilo contra la opresión.

How pure, Chile, is your blue sky
And how pure the breezes that blow across you
And your countryside embroidered with flowers
Is a wonderful copy of Eden
How majestic are the snow-covered mountains
𝄆 That were given to you by God as protection 𝄇
𝄆 And the sea that tranquilly bathes your shores
Promises a splendor future for you. 𝄇

Chorus:
Beloved Homeland, receive the vows
That Chile gave you on your altars
𝄆 That you be either the tomb of the free
Or a refuge from oppression 𝄇
That you be either the tomb of the free
Or a refuge from oppression
Or a refuge from oppression
Or a refuge from oppression
According to Chilean Constitution [decree 260], only the fifth verse and the chorus are played officially as the National Anthem.
Coro:
Dulce Patria, recibe los votos
con que Chile en tus aras juró
que o la tumba serás de los libres
o el asilo contra la opresión.

I
Ha cesado la lucha sangrienta;
ya es hermano el que ayer invasor;
de tres siglos lavamos la afrenta
combatiendo en el campo de honor.
El que ayer doblegábase esclavo
libre al fin y triunfante se ve;
libertad es la herencia del bravo,
la Victoria se humilla a su pie.

II
Alza, Chile, sin mancha la frente;
conquistaste tu nombre en la lid;
siempre noble, constante y valiente
te encontraron los hijos del Cid.
Que tus libres tranquilos coronen
a las artes, la industria y la paz,
y de triunfos cantares entonen
que amedrenten al déspota audaz.

III
Vuestros nombres, valientes soldados,
que habéis sido de Chile el sostén,
nuestros pechos los llevan grabados;
los sabrán nuestros hijos también.
Sean ellos el grito de muerte
que lancemos marchando a lidiar,
y sonando en la boca del fuerte
hagan siempre al tirano temblar.

IV
Si pretende el cañón extranjero
nuestros pueblos, osado, invadir;
desnudemos al punto el acero
y sepamos vencer o morir.
Con su sangre el altivo araucano
nos legó, por herencia, el valor;
y no tiembla la espada en la mano
defendiendo, de Chile, el honor.

V (verso oficial)
Puro, Chile, es tu cielo azulado,
puras brisas te cruzan también,
y tu campo de flores bordado
es la copia feliz del Edén.
Majestuosa es la blanca montaña
que te dio por baluarte el Señor,
Y ese mar que tranquilo te baña
te promete futuro esplendor.

VI
Esas galas, ¡oh, Patria!, esas flores
que tapizan tu suelo feraz,
no las pisen jamás invasores;
con tu sombra las cubra la paz.
Nuestros pechos serán tu baluarte,
con tu nombre sabremos vencer,
o tu noble, glorioso estandarte,
nos verá, combatiendo, caer.
Chorus:
Sweet Homeland, receive the vows
That Chile gave you on your altars
That you be either the tomb of the free
Or a refuge from oppression

I
The bloody fight has ceased; 
and yesterday's invader is now our brother;
three centuries we washed the affront
fighting in the field of honor.
That who yesterday was a slave
is free and triumphant today;
freedom is the heritage of the brave,
Victory lies shameful to his feet.

II
Rise, Chile, with a spotless forehead;
you conquered your name on the fight;
always noble, constant and courageous
the children of the Cid found you.
May your free calmly crown
the arts, industry and peace,
and may they sing songs of your triumph
to intimidate the daring despot.

III
Your names, brave soldiers
who have been Chile's mainstay,
they are engraved in our chests;
our children will know them as well.
May they be the death cry
that comes out when we march to the fight,
and ringing in the mouth of the strong
they always make the tyrant tremble.

IV
If the foreign cannon intends
to invade, daring, our people;
let's draw our arms
and know victory or death.
With its blood the proud Araucanian
inherited its courage to us;
and the sword doesn't tremble in the hand
of that who defends the honor of Chile.

V (official verse)
How pure, Chile, is your blue sky
And how pure the breezes that blow across you
And your countryside embroidered with flowers
Is a wonderful copy of Eden
How majestic are the snow-covered mountains
That were given to you by God as protection
And the sea that tranquilly bathes your shores
Promises future splendor for you

VI
That pride, oh, Homeland!, those flowers
growing on your fertile soil,
may they never be stepped on by invaders;
may your shadow cover them with peace.
Our chests will be your bastion
in your name we will know how to win,
or your noble, glorious emblem
will see us fall in the fight.
The following lyrics were used during the military regime in the country. Both the 5th and 3rd verses were used.
