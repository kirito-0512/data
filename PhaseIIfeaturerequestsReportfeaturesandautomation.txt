This page is obsolete!
It is an archive of old feature requests that were still active on 2002 July 20, when we moved from Phase II to Phase III of the software.
Many requests were implemented then, while others became obsolete due to being rejected by the community.
See Wikipedia:Feature requests for current requests.
The whole Page titles to be deleted mechanism is unnecessarily burdensome. The software should be capable of automatically deleting pages that have no content other than whitespace.
