Emperor Toba (鳥羽天皇, Toba-tennō, February 24, 1103 – July 20, 1156) was the 74th Emperor of Japan,[1] according to the traditional order of succession.[2]
Toba's reign spanned the years from 1107 through 1123.[3]
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his imina)[4] was Munehito-shinnō (宗仁親王).[5]
He was the son of Emperor Horikawa.  His mother was Empress Dowager Fujiwara no Ishi (藤原苡子)
Toba had three Empresses, some consort ladies and 14 imperial sons and daughters.[6]
When his mother died, his grandfather, former-Emperor Shirakawa, took him under his care and raised him.
During the initial years of Toba's reign, the actual power was held by his grandfather, the "retired" Emperor Shirakawa, in a process known as cloistered rule.

The years of Toba's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.[14]
