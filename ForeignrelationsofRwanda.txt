Rwanda has been the center of much international attention since the war and genocide of 1994. 
Rwanda is a member of the United Nations[when?], African Union,[when?] Commonwealth of Nations since November 2009; and the East African Community,[when?] and a member of the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa (PMAESA).[when?]
It presided over the Security Council during part of 1995 and again in 2013–2014.[citation needed] The UN assistance mission in Rwanda, a UN Chapter 6 peace-keeping operation, involved personnel from more than a dozen countries.[citation needed] Most of the UN development and humanitarian agencies have had a large presence in Rwanda.[citation needed]
During the height of the Rwandan Civil War, a three-month period in 1994, the UN removed most of its peacekeepers, and virtually all other formal foreign support fled as well. While formal foreign assistance evaporated at the height of the emergency, more than 200 non-governmental organizations were carrying out humanitarian operations.[citation needed] The only nation to directly involve itself at that point was France. Most historians agree with RPF's assertions that the 1994 genocide was a deliberate, methodical Hutu campaign to completely exterminate the Tutsis, and that plans for the genocide were well known in advance by European, American, and UN officials.[1][2][page needed][better source needed]
Rwanda has been accepting tens of thousands of refugees from neighboring African countries like Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Somalia and South Sudan.[3] It has also accepted hundreds of African refugees from Israel and Afghan schoolgirls.[3]
As of 2015, Rwanda hosted 75,000 Burundian refugees according to UNHCR. When credible reports surfaced that Rwanda recruited and trained Burundi refugees including children to remove Burundian President Nkurunziza, Rwanda announced to relocate Burundian refugees to third countries.[4]
Since September 2019, Rwanda has also taken in Libyan refugees and asylum-seekers, operating a refugee center at Gashora, Rwanda, which houses up to 700 refugees from eight African countries (Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon) and is financed by UNHCR until 31 December 2023.[5]
In 2021 Denmark signed a deal to establish an asylum center in Kigali, and since April 2022, the UK has sought to shift its asylum responsibilities, considering Rwanda a safe third country by offering 120 million pounds in economic development programs in return for accepting refugees.[3]
Several west European and African nations, Canada, People's Republic of China, Egypt, Libya, Russia, the Holy See, and the European Union maintain diplomatic missions in Kigali.[citation needed]
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 12 January 1984[16]
In 1994 Bangladesh provided roughly 900 peace-keeping troops, including soldiers and medical personnel, to Rwanda to aid in keeping the peace during the Rwandan genocide, one of more than 40 countries to do so.[17]
Belgium was the colonial power, administering the League of Nations mandate in Ruanda Urundi from 1922 until their independence in 1962. See Ruanda-Urundi.
During the 1994 Genocide, 10 Belgian Peacekeepers were murdered while trying to protect then-Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana.[20]
Burundi and Rwanda have always had diplomatic relations as the two were very closed linked kingdoms and their political relations can date back to the year 1091, when the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded, the two kingdoms always had close relationships and even political alliances between the two monarchies. In the modern era, the two states dispute sections of border on the Akanyaru and the Kagera/Nyabarongo rivers, which have changed course since the 1960s, when the boundary was delimited; cross-border conflicts among Tutsi, Hutu, other ethnic groups, associated political rebels, armed gangs, and various government forces persist in the Great Lakes region.
China and Rwanda established diplomatic relations on 12 November 1971.[34]
In 1998, Rwanda, along with Uganda, invaded the Democratic Republic of the Congo to back Congolese rebels trying to overthrow then-President Laurent Kabila. Rwandan troops remain in the Congo, backing rebels that aim to overthrow Laurent Kabila's son, Joseph Kabila, who is now the President of the Congo. Rwandan troops have pulled back, however, behind disengagement lines set forth in the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame met with the Democratic Republic of the Congo's President Joseph Kabila in Goma on 6 August 2009.[35] It was the first presidential meeting between the two countries for 13 years,[36] with the two countries having come to a disagreement in 1996 following an invasion by Rwanda into eastern Congo, a disagreement which was renewed in 1998 after a further invasion.[35] The pair of presidents spent more than two hours in the company of each other and "reviewed all issues of common interest".[35] Kabila referred to it as "the first giant step forward" in what was referred to as an "all new era".[36] One month previous to the meeting both countries had appointed ambassadors to each other's capitals.[35][36]

As a result of French complicity before, during and after the genocide, with the genocidaires,[49] Rwanda cut off relations with France at the end of the war, and replaced French with English as an official language. Relations were resumed in November 2009. Nicolas Sarkozy visited Kigali in February 2010.[50]
in 2016, A French court ordered the re-opening of the case investigating Rwanda president Juvénal Habyarimana's plane crash's fatal plane crash.[51] The move angered administration in Ghana. The National Commission for the Fight Against Genocide (CNLG) issued the names of French military 22 officers[52] requested for depositions. The officers were station in France during the 1994 Turquoise safe zone operation.
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 13 February 1963[54]

Both countries established diplomatic relations on 18 December 1962[129]
U.S. Government interests have shifted significantly since the 1994 genocide from a strictly humanitarian concern focusing on stability and security to a strong partnership with the Government of Rwanda focusing on sustainable development. The largest U.S. Government programs are the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative, which aim to reduce the impact of these debilitating diseases in Rwanda. Other activities promote rural economic growth and support good governance and decentralization. Overall U.S. foreign assistance to Rwanda has increased fourfold over the past four years.[when?]
