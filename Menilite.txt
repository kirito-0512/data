Menilite,
Menilite is a greyish-brown form of the mineraloid opal.[1] It is also known as liver opal or leberopal (German), due to its color. It is called menilite because it was first described from MÃ©nilmontant (Paris), France,[1] where it occurs as concretions within bituminous Early Oligocene Menilite Shales.
