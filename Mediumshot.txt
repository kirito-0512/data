Mediumshot,
In a movie a medium shot, mid shot (MS),[1] or waist shot[2] is a camera angle shot from a medium distance.[3]
Medium shots are favored in sequences where dialogues or a small group of people are acting, as they give the viewer a partial view of the background, such as when the shot is 'cutting the person in half'[3] and also show the subjects' facial expressions in the context of their body language.[4] Medium shots are also used when the subject in the shot is delivering information, such as news presenters.[1] It is also used in interviews.[2] It is the most common shot in movies,[5][6] and it usually follows the first establishing shots of a new scene or location.[6]
A normal lens that sees what the human eye see,[7] is usually used for medium shots.[6]
The medium shot shows equality between subjects and background. The dividing line between what constitutes a long shot and medium shot is not definite, nor is the line between medium shot and close-up.[6] In some standard texts and professional references, a full-length view of a human subject is called a medium shot;[5] in this terminology, a shot of the person from the knees up or the waist up is a close-up shot. In other texts, these partial views are called medium shots.[8] In principal, the medium shot is what can be seen with the human eye in a single quick glance and convey all the action taking place in that field of view.[5][1]
Medium shots are divided into singles (a waist-high shot of one actor), group shots, over-the shoulders or two-shots (featuring two people).[5] A medium wide shot, or American shot, shows a bit more of the background but is still close enough for facial expressions to be seen, although these facial expressions would be better seen in a waist-high shot.[9]
