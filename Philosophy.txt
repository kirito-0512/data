Philosophy,

Philosophy (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, philosophia, 'love of wisdom')[1][2] is the systematized study of general and fundamental questions, such as those concerning existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and language.[3][4] Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.[5][i]
Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher.[6] Natural philosophy, the origins of which trace back to Ancient Greece, encompasses astronomy, medicine, and physics.[7][8] In the transition to the modern era, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics.
Today, major subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics, which is concerned with the fundamental nature of existence and reality; epistemology, which studies the nature of knowledge and belief; ethics, which is concerned with moral value; and logic, which studies the rules of inference that allow one to derive conclusions from true premises. The history of philosophy is itself a philosophical undertaking. Other notable subfields include philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind.
The word "philosophy" comes from the ancient Greek words φίλος (philos: "love") and σοφία (sophia: "wisdom").[9][10][11] Etymologically, it means "the love of wisdom". Some sources claim the term was coined by Presocratic philosopher Pythagoras, but this is not certain.[12][13]
The word entered the English language primarily from Old French and Anglo-Norman starting around 1175 CE. The French term philosophie is itself a borrowing from the Latin term philosophia. The term philosophy acquired, and to some extent still retains, the meanings of "advanced study of the speculative subjects (logic, ethics, physics, and metaphysics)", "deep wisdom consisting of love of truth and virtuous living", "profound learning as transmitted by the ancient writers", and "the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, and the basic limits of human understanding".[14][9]
Before the modern age, the term philosophy was used in a very wide sense. It included most forms of rational inquiry, like the individual sciences, as its subdisciplines.[9][15][16] For instance, natural philosophy was considered a major branch of philosophy.[17][18] It encompassed a wide range of fields, including disciplines like physics, chemistry, and biology.[9][19] An example of this usage is the 1687 book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton. This book referred to natural philosophy in its title, but it is today considered a book of physics.[20][7]
The meaning of the term philosophy changed toward the end of the modern period to acquire the more narrow meaning common today. In this new sense, the term is mainly associated with a number of specific philosophical disciplines like metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Among other topics, it covers the rational study of reality, knowledge, and values. But it is distinguished from other disciplines of rational inquiry like the empirical sciences and mathematics.[21]
The practice of philosophy is characterized by various general features: it is a form of rational inquiry, it aims to be systematic, and it tends to critically reflect on its own methods and presuppositions.[22][23][20] It requires thinking "as hard and as clearly...about some of the most interesting and enduring problems that human minds have ever encountered"; many of these we cannot avoid, but are unable to answer once and for all.[24]
For instance, according to the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant, the task of philosophy is united by four questions: (1) What can I know?; (2) What should I do?; (3) What may I hope?; and (4) What is the human being?[25][26] His entire career, as he conceived it, was devoted to systematically addressing these four questions.[27]
Bertrand Russell offers this justification for undertaking the labor of philosophical thought: 
The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which have grown up in his mind without the cooperation or consent of his deliberate reason.[28]Aristotle, more generously, opens his Metaphysics by explaining the need for philosophy with the claim that "All human beings by nature stretch themselves out toward knowing".[29] In a further passage, he adds, it is "by way of wondering [that] people both now and at first begin to philosophize, wondering first about the strange things near at hand, then going forward little by little in this way and coming to impasses about greater things".[30]
Attempts to define philosophy in more precise and specific terms are typically controversial.[23][20] Some approaches argue that there is a set of essential features shared by all parts of philosophy, while others see only weaker family resemblances or contend that it is merely an empty blanket term.[31][32][33] Often, they are only accepted by theorists belonging to a certain philosophical movement and are revisionistic in that many presumed parts of philosophy would not deserve the title "philosophy" if they were true.[34][31]
Some definitions characterize philosophy in relation to its method, like pure reasoning. Others focus more on its topic, for example, as the study of the biggest patterns of the world as a whole or as the attempt to answer the big questions.[31][35][36] Both approaches have the problem that they are usually either too wide, by including non-philosophical disciplines, or too narrow, by excluding some philosophical sub-disciplines.[31]
Many definitions of philosophy emphasize its intimate relation to science.[20] In this sense, philosophy is sometimes understood as a proper science in its own right. According to some naturalistic philosophers, like Willard Van Orman Quine, philosophy is an empirical yet very abstract science that is concerned with very wide-ranging empirical patterns instead of particular observations.[31][37] Science-based definitions usually face the problem of explaining why philosophy in its long history has not made the type of progress as seen in other sciences.[31][38][39] This problem is avoided by seeing philosophy as an immature or provisional science whose subdisciplines cease to be philosophy once they have fully developed.[20][32][40] In this sense, philosophy is the midwife of the sciences.[20]
Other definitions focus more on the contrast between science and philosophy. A common theme among many such conceptions is that philosophy is concerned with meaning, understanding, or the clarification of language.[31][35] According to one view, philosophy is conceptual analysis, which involves finding the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of concepts.[31][36][41]
Another presents philosophy as a linguistic therapy. According to Ludwig Wittgenstein, for example, philosophy aims at dispelling misunderstandings to which humans are susceptible due to the confusing structure of natural language.[20][34][42]
Some phenomenologists, such as Edmund Husserl and his followers, characterize philosophy as the science of essences.[34][40][43]
Many other conceptions of philosophy do not clearly fall into any of the aforementioned categories. An early approach found in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, that philosophy is the spiritual practice of developing one's rational capacities, has been rehabilitated by philosophers such as Pierre Hadot and Michel Foucault.[44][45] This practice is an expression of the philosopher's love of wisdom and has the aim of improving one's well-being by leading a reflective life.[46] A closely related approach identifies the development and articulation of worldviews as the principal task of philosophy, i.e., to express how things on the grand scale hang together and which practical stance we should take towards them.[22][31][47] Another definition characterizes philosophy as thinking about thinking in order to emphasize its reflective nature.[31][36]
The history of philosophy studies the development of philosophical thought. It aims to provide a systematic and chronological exposition of philosophical concepts and doctrines.[48][49][50] Some theorists see it as a part of intellectual history, but it also investigates questions not covered by intellectual history such as whether the theories of past philosophers are true and philosophically relevant today.[51] The history of philosophy is primarily concerned with theories based on rational inquiry and argumentation. However, some historians understand it in a looser sense that includes myths, religious teachings, and proverbial lore.[52] The main traditions in the history of philosophy include Western, Arabic-Persian, Indian, and Chinese philosophy, the latter two of which are often referred to under the broader heading of Eastern philosophy. Other influential philosophical traditions are Japanese philosophy, Latin American philosophy, and African philosophy.[53]
Western philosophy covers philosophical thought linked to the geographical region and cultural heritage of the Western world.[54][55] It originated in Ancient Greece in the 6th century BCE with the Presocratics. They attempted to provide rational explanations of the cosmos as a whole.[56][57][58] The philosophy following them was shaped by Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. They expanded the range of topics to questions like how people should act, how to arrive at knowledge, and what the nature of reality and mind is.[59][60] The later part of the ancient period was marked by the emergence of philosophical movements including like Epicureanism, Stoicism, Skepticism, and Neoplatonism.[61][62][63] The medieval period started in the 5th century CE. Its focus was on religious topics and many thinkers used ancient philosophy to explain and further elaborate Christian doctrine.[64][65][66]
The Renaissance period started in the 14th century and saw a renewed interest in various schools of Ancient philosophy, in particular Platonism. The idea of humanism also emerged in this period.[67] The following modern period started in the 17th century. One of its central concerns was how philosophical and scientific knowledge are created. Specific importance was given to the role of reason and sensory experience.[68][69] Many of these innovations were used in the Enlightenment movement to challenge traditional authorities.[70][71] Various attempts to develop all-inclusive systems of philosophy were made in the later part of the modern period, for example, by German idealism.[72] Influential developments in 20th-century philosophy were the emergence and application of formal logic and the focus on the role of language as well as philosophical movements like phenomenology and pragmatism.[73][74] The 20th century saw a rapid expansion of academic philosophy in terms of the number of philosophical publications and of philosophers working at academic institutions.[73] There was also a noticeable growth in the number of female philosophers but they still remained underrepresented.[75]
Arabic-Persian philosophy is the philosophical tradition of Arabic- and Persian-speaking regions.[76][77] It started in the early 9th century CE and had its peak period during the Islamic Golden Age. It was strongly influenced by Ancient Greek philosophers and employed their ideas to elaborate and interpret the teachings of the Quran.[78]
Al-Kindi is usually regarded as the first philosopher of this tradition. He translated and interpreted many works of Aristotle and Neoplatonists in his attempt to show that there is a harmony between reason and faith.[79] Avicenna also followed this goal and developed a comprehensive philosophical system to provide a rational understanding of reality encompassing science, religion, and mysticism.[80][81] Al-Ghazali was a strong critic of the idea that reason can arrive at a true understanding of reality and God. He formulated a detailed critique of philosophy and tried to assign philosophy a more limited place beside the teachings of the Quran and mystical insight.[82] Following Al-Ghazali and the end of the Islamic Golden Age, the influence of philosophical inquiry waned.[83][84] Mulla Sadra is often regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the subsequent period.[85][86]
Indian philosophy covers philosophical thought that originated on the Indian subcontinent.[87][88] One of its distinguishing features is its integrated exploration of the nature of reality, the ways of arriving at knowledge, and the spiritual question of how to reach enlightenment.[89][90] It started around 900 BCE when the religious scriptures known as the Vedas were written. They contemplate issues concerning the relation between the self and ultimate reality as well as the question of how souls are reborn based on their past actions.[91] This period also saw the emergence of non-Vedic teachings, like Buddhism and Jainism.[92][93]
The subsequent classical period started roughly 200 BCE and was characterized by the emergence of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism. They are known as the astikas and are Nyāyá, Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā, and Vedanta.[94][95][96] The school of Advaita Vedanta developed later in this period. It claimed that everything is one and that the impression of a universe consisting of many distinct entities is an illusion.[97][98][99] The modern period began roughly 1800 CE and was shaped by the encounter with Western thought.[100][101] Various philosophers tried to formulate comprehensive systems to harmonize diverse philosophical and religious teachings. For example, Swami Vivekananda used the teachings of Advaita Vedanta to argue that all the different religions are valid paths toward the one divine.[102]
Chinese philosophy encompasses the philosophical and intellectual heritage of China. Compared to the other main traditions, it placed less emphasis on questions of ultimate reality. It was more interested in practical questions associated with right social conduct and government.[103] It originated in the 6th century BCE when the schools of Confucianism and Daoism emerged. Confucian thought focused on different forms of moral virtues and explored how they lead to harmony in society.[104] Daoism broadened this focus to also include questions about the relation between humans and nature.[105] The introduction of Buddhism to China in the following period resulted in the development of new forms of Buddhism.[106]
The modern period in Chinese philosophy began in the early 20th century and was shaped by the influence of and reactions to Western philosophy. Of particular importance were the ideas of Karl Marx on class struggle, socialism, and communism. They led to the development of Chinese Marxism and resulted in a significant transformation of the political landscape when Mao Zedong worked on their practical implementation in the form of a communist revolution.[107]
Philosophical questions can be grouped into various branches. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions. Metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and logic are sometimes listed as the main branches.[108][109][110] There are many other subfields besides them and the different divisions are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive. For example, political philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics are sometimes linked under the general heading of value theory as they involve a normative or evaluative aspect.[111] Furthermore, philosophical inquiry sometimes overlaps with other disciplines in the natural or social sciences, religion, or mathematics.[112][113]
Ethics, also known as moral philosophy, studies what constitutes right conduct. It is also concerned with the moral evaluation of character traits and institutions. It explores what the standards of morality are and how to live a good life.[115][116][117]
Philosophical ethics addresses such basic questions as Are ethics relative?; Which is more important: well-being or obligation?; and What gives life meaning?[118]
The main branches of ethics are meta-ethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics. Meta-ethics asks abstract questions about the nature and sources of morality. It analyzes the meaning of ethical concepts, like right action and obligation. It also investigates whether ethical theories can be true in an absolute sense and how to aquire knowledge of them. Normative ethics encompasses general theories of how to distinguish between right and wrong conduct. It helps guide moral decisions by examining what moral obligations and rights people have. Applied ethics studies the consequences of the general theories developed by normative ethics in specific situations, for example, in the workplace or for medical treatments.[119]
Within contemporary normative ethics, consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics are influential schools of thought.
Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledge.[122] Epistemologists examine putative sources of knowledge, including perceptual experience, reason, memory, and testimony. They also investigate questions about the nature of truth, belief, justification, and rationality.[123]
Some of the questions addressed by epistemology include By what method(s) can one acquire knowledge?; How is truth established?; and Can we prove causal relations?[124]
Philosophical skepticism, which raises doubts about some or all claims to knowledge, has been a topic of interest throughout the history of philosophy. It arose early in Presocratic philosophy and became formalized with Pyrrho, the founder of the earliest Western school of philosophical skepticism. It features prominently in the works of modern philosophers René Descartes and David Hume and has remained a central topic in contemporary epistemological debates.[123]
One central debate in contemporary epistemology is about the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge, which might include truth and justification. This debate was largely the result of attempts to solve the Gettier problem, according to which well justified reasons for a belief turn out to be false.[123] Another common subject of contemporary debates is the regress problem, which occurs when trying to offer proof or justification for any belief, statement, or proposition. The problem is that whatever the source of justification may be, that source must either be without justification (in which case it must be treated as an arbitrary foundation for belief), or it must have some further justification (in which case justification must either be the result of circular reasoning, as in coherentism, or the result of an infinite regress, as in infinitism).[123]
Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality, such as existence, time, objects and their properties, wholes and their parts, events, processes and causation and the relationship between mind and body.[125] Metaphysics includes cosmology, the study of the world in its entirety and ontology, the study of being, along with the philosophy of space and time.
It attempts to answer such basic question as Why is there something rather than nothing?; Of what does reality ultimately consist?; and Are humans free?[126]
Metaphysics deals with the topic of identity. Essence is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity, while accident is a property that the object has, without which the object can still retain its identity. Particulars are objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to abstract objects, such as numbers, and universals, which are properties held by multiple particulars, such as redness or a gender. The type of existence, if any, of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate.
Logic is the study of reasoning and argument.
Deductive reasoning is when, given certain premises, conclusions are unavoidably implied.[127] Rules of inference are used to infer conclusions such as, modus ponens, where given "A" and "If A then B", then "B" must be concluded.
Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences,[128] social sciences and humanities disciplines, logic became a formal science. Sub-fields include mathematical logic, philosophical logic, modal logic, computational logic, and non-classical logics.
There are many additional subfields of philosophy beside its main branches.[129]
Aesthetics is the "critical reflection on art, culture, and nature".[130][131] It addresses the nature of art, beauty, and taste; enjoyment, emotional values, perception; and the creation and appreciation of beauty.[132] It is more precisely defined as the study of sensory or sensory-emotional values, sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste.[133]
Philosophy of language explores the nature, origins, and use of language. Philosophy of mind explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body, as typified by disputes between reductive materialism and dualism. In recent years, this branch has become related to cognitive science.
The philosophy of science explores the foundations, methods, history, implications and purpose of science. Many of its subdivisions correspond to specific branches of science. For example, philosophy of biology deals specifically with the metaphysical, epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences.
Political philosophy is the study of government and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the state. It includes questions about justice, law, property and the rights and obligations of the citizen. 
Philosophy of religion deals with questions that involve religion and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective (as opposed to theology which begins from religious convictions).[134] Traditionally, religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper, and the idea of a separate field only arose in the 19th century.[ii] Issues include the existence of God, the relationship between reason and faith, questions of religious epistemology, the relationship between religion and science, how to interpret religious experiences, questions about the possibility of an afterlife, the problem of religious language, the existence of souls, and responses to religious pluralism and diversity.
Methods of philosophy are ways of conducting philosophical inquiry. They include techniques for arriving at philosophical knowledge and justifying philosophical claims as well as principles used for choosing between competing theories.[135][136][137]
A great variety of methods has been employed throughout the history of philosophy. Many of them differ significantly from the methods used in the natural sciences in that they do not use experimental data obtained through measuring equipment.[138][139][140]
The choice of one's method usually has important implications both for how philosophical theories are constructed and for the arguments cited for or against them.[136][141][142] This choice is often guided by epistemological considerations about what constitutes philosophical evidence, how much support it offers, and how to acquire it.[138][136][143]
Various disagreements on the level of philosophical theories have their source in methodological disagreements and the discovery of new methods has often had important consequences both for how philosophers conduct their research and for what claims they defend.[144][137][136] Some philosophers engage in most of their theorizing using one particular method while others employ a wider range of methods based on which one fits the specific problem investigated best.[139][145]
Conceptual analysis is a well-known method in analytic philosophy. It aims to clarify the meaning of concepts by analyzing them into their fundamental constituents.[146][41][22] Another method often employed in analytic philosophy is based on common sense. It starts with commonly accepted beliefs and tries to draw interesting conclusions from them, which it often employs in a negative sense to criticize philosophical theories that are too far removed from how the average person sees the issue.[140][147][148] It is very similar to how ordinary language philosophy tackles philosophical questions by investigating how ordinary language is used.[137][149][150]
Various methods in philosophy give particular importance to intuitions, that is, non-inferential impressions about the correctness of specific claims or general principles.[144][151] For example, they play an important role in thought experiments, which employ counterfactual thinking to evaluate the possible consequences of an imagined situation. These anticipated consequences can then be used to confirm or refute philosophical theories.[152][153][146] The method of reflective equilibrium also employs intuitions. It seeks to form a coherent position on a certain issue by examining all the relevant beliefs and intuitions, some of which often have to be deemphasized or reformulated in order to arrive at a coherent perspective.[144][154][155]
Pragmatists stress the significance of concrete practical consequences for assessing whether a philosophical theory is true.[156][157] According to the pragmatic maxim as formulated by Charles Sanders Peirce, the idea a person has of an object is nothing more than the totality of practical consequences they associate with this object. The goal of this approach is to clarify and resolve abstract and intractable philosophical disputes in a down-to-earth fashion. Pragmatists have also used this method to expose merely verbal disagreements that make no genuine difference on the level of consequences.[156][158]
Phenomenologists seek knowledge of the realm of appearance and the structure of human experience. Their inquiry starts from a first-person perspective and proceeds by suspending all judgments about the external world. This technique of phenomenological reduction is known as "bracketing" or epoché. The goal is to give an unbiased description of the appearances of things.[159][137][160][161]
Philosophy is closely related to many other fields. It is sometimes understood as a metadiscipline that clarifies their nature and limits. It does this by critically examining their basic concepts, background assumptions, and methods. In this regard, it plays a key role in providing an interdisciplinary perspective. It bridges the gap between different disciplines by analyzing which concepts and problems they have in common. It shows how they overlap while also delimiting their scope.[162] Historically, philosophy is often considered the "mother of all sciences" since most of the individual sciences formed part of philosophy until they reached their status as autonomous disciplines.[15][16]
The influence of philosophy is felt in various fields that require difficult practical decisions. In bioethics, philosophical considerations affect issues like whether an embryo is already a person and under what conditions abortion is morally permissible. A closely related philosophical problem is how humans should treat other animals, for example, whether it is acceptable to use non-human animals as food or for research experiments. In relation to business and professional life, philosophy has contributed by providing ethical frameworks. They contain guidelines on which business practices are morally acceptable and cover the issue of the corporate social responsibility of CEOs and stockholders. In the field of politics, philosophy addresses issues like what the ideal form of government is and how to assess whether a government policy is just.[163][164][165]
Philosophical inquiry is relevant to many fields that are concerned with what to believe and how to arrive at evidence for one's beliefs.[166] This is a key issue for the sciences, which have as one of their prime objectives the creation of scientific knowledge. Scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence but it is often not clear whether empirical observations are neutral or already include theoretical assumptions. A closely related problem is whether the available evidence is sufficient to decide between competing theories.[167][168]
In the fields of theology and religion, there are many doctrines associated with the existence and nature of God as well as rules governing correct behavior. A key issue is whether a rational person should believe these doctrines, for example, whether revelation in the form of holy books and religious experiences of the divine are sufficient evidence for these beliefs.[169][170][171]
A similar problem in relation to the law is what counts as evidence and how much evidence is required to find a person guilty of a crime. A related problem affects journalists who have to decide whether a source of information is reliable. Another philosophical issue in this field is how to ensure objectivity when reporting on events and how to avoid implicit or explicit biases.[162]
Philosophy in the form of logic has been influential in the field of mathematics and  computer science.[172][173][174] Further fields influenced by philosophy include psychology, sociology, linguistics, education, and art.[175] The close relation between philosophy and other fields is also reflected in the fact that many philosophy graduates go on to work in related fields rather than in philosophy itself.[176]
On a cultural level, philosophy helps shape the self-understanding of a society by making its norms and values explicit. It does this, for example, by examining and comparing worldviews. Such comparisons can show how one culture differs from another and how different attitudes toward the same issue are possible. Besides articulating dominant norms and values, philosophy can also act as a critical voice that points out their shortcomings. On a more personal level, it encourages critical thinking and open-mindedness by prompting individuals to question the assumptions and values they hold.[177]
One example of the cultural and critical role of philosophy is found in its influence on the social and political movement known as feminism. It has shaped the understanding of key concepts in feminism, for instance, the meaning of gender, how it differs from biological sex, and what role it plays in the formation of personal identity. Philosophers have also investigated the concepts of justice and equality and what implications they have for the unfair treatment of women in male-dominated societies.[178][179][180]
However, the idea that philosophy is useful for many aspects of life and society is sometimes rejected. According to one such view, philosophy is a useless activity that is only done for its own sake. This would mean that it does not help existing practices and makes no significant contributions to external goals.[181][182][183] Other criticisms see philosophy as an outdated enterprise that should be replaced by empirical sciences or hold that philosophical claims are meaningless.[184][185][186]
