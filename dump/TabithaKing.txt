Tabitha Jane King (née Spruce, born March 24, 1949) is an American author.[1][2][3]
Tabitha King is the third eldest daughter of Sarah Jane Spruce (née White; December 7, 1923 – April 14, 2007) [4] and Raymond George Spruce (December 29, 1923 – May 29, 2014).[5] King attended John Bapst Memorial High School in Bangor, Maine[6] before enrolling at the University of Maine, where she met her husband Stephen King through her work-study job in the Raymond H. Fogler Library.
As of 2006, King had published eight novels and two works of non-fiction.[7][8] She published her first novel, Small World, through Signet Books in 1981,[9] and in 2006, Candles Burning was published through Berkley Books.[10][11]  The paperback rights for Small World were bought by New American Library for $165,000.[12] Candles Burning was written predominantly by Michael McDowell, who died in 1999, and the McDowell family requested that King finish the work.[13]
King has served on several boards and committees in the state of Maine, such as the Bangor Public Library board.[14] She also served on the board of the Maine Public Broadcasting System until 1994.[15] In 1998 she received the inaugural Constance H. Carlson Public Humanities Prize, the Maine Humanities Council's highest award, for her work with literacy for the state of Maine.[16]
She currently serves as vice president of WZON/WZLO/WKIT radio stations as well as in the administration of two family philanthropic foundations.[14]
Reception to King's work has ranged from negative to positive.[17][18][19] Pearl received positive mentions from the Los Angeles Times and the Bangor Daily News,[20][21] while the Chicago Tribune panned Survivor.[22] The Arizona Daily Star criticized One on One, calling King "a hack",[23] whereas Entertainment Weekly, Time, and the Rocky Mountain News gave the novel positive reviews.[24][25][26] Caretakers received positive praise by The New York Times,[27] while Bookreporter.com wrote that some readers might be disappointed by the changes made to McDowell's Candles Burning.[28]
Tabitha and Stephen King married on January 2, 1971.[32][33][34][35] They have three children: a daughter Naomi and two sons, Joe Hill and Owen King, who are both writers.[36]
