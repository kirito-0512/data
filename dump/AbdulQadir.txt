AbdulQadir,
Abd al-Qadir or Abdulkadir (Arabic: عبد القادر) is a male Muslim given name. It is formed from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Qadir. The name means "servant of who can everything", Al=The. Al-Qādir being one of the names of Allah in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.[1][2]
The letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abdal. The second part can be transliterated Qader, Kadir, Qadir, Kader, Gadir or in other ways, and the whole name subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.
There is a related but much less common name, Abdul Qadeer (Arabic: عبد القدیر), with a similar meaning. The two may become confused when transliterated, and a few of the names below may be instances of the latter name.
