TransportinVanuatu,
Vanuatu's undeveloped road system, with fewer than 100 miles of paved roads, consists mostly of dirt tracks suitable only for four-wheel-drive vehicles.[1] Every island has one or two short airstrips where Vanair’s Twin Otter planes land two or three times weekly.[1] In addition, every island has a small port or wharf where small cargo ships and boats regularly dock.[1]
After arrival on an island, transportation is usually via pickup truck, foot, or small boat.[1] Bicycles are becoming popular in Vanuatu. Port Vila and Luganville have numerous taxis and mass-transit vans.[1] There are no railways in Vanuatu, although there was a small rail line on Efate during the colonial era.[2]
Vanuatu's main harbors are Forari, Port-Vila, Santo (Espiritu Santo).[2]
