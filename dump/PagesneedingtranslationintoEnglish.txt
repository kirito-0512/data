This encyclopedia is written in English (see Main Page#Wikipedia languages). With this being said, this page is a place to list articles written in languages other than English, to see if they can be translated before they are listed at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion. If someone speaks the language the article is written in and can state that it is not worth translating, the item should be moved to AfD or tagged with {{prod}}. Please keep in mind that drafts are considered out of scope for this page.
If an article has been listed here for two weeks and is still untranslated, it should be removed from Wikipedia following one of the processes laid out in our deletion policy.
There are two main ways you can help this project:
Note: you can click the same language multiple times, and it will give you a different article each time you click it (if there is more than one for that language).
You can also view a list of all articles in need of post-translation cleanup for a given language at these links: 
Albanian, Arabic, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese.

If you are here for the first time and have an article in a language other than English or a poorly translated article that you wish to list here to forestall possible deletion, you should start by finding the most appropriate template from among the ones listed at Wikipedia:Template messages/Translation and add it to the article page, save the page, and then follow the instructions in the banner on how to list the article here.  You might need to click '[show]' to see all the instructions.
If you want to ask for a translation into English of an article from a another language's Wikipedia, go to Wikipedia:Translation.

Listing a page here
Most pages get listed here by subst'ing a {{Needtrans}} template, following the instructions given at any one of several translation-related templates that are added to the article page.  Many of the templates found at Wikipedia:Template messages/Translation propose adding the corresponding article here.
See section Translation template usage below for details of the templates available for use on the main article page.
Other ways to find articles for inclusion on this page are:

Tagging
If the article is a mere copy of (all or part of) an article in another language's Wikipedia, it can just be tagged with {{db-foreign}} to get added to Wikipedia:Candidates for speedy deletion: we want to discourage people who cut articles from one Wikipedia and paste to another without translating. You can leave a message on the contributing user's talk-page in their own language, using the templates from WP:PNT/Templates for user talk pages or using {{UE}}; this will point them to the appropriate Wikipedia in the language they used.

Replacement and restoration
Sometimes, legitimate articles are replaced by content in other languages. In this case, the last English-language version should be restored from the history.
In addition, you may leave a message on the user's talk-page as indicated above.

Notification
When listing a page here, you might want to find the Wikipedia:Embassy, Ambassador, or Wikipedia:Local embassy member of the Wikipedia that relates to the language the article is in and invite them to move the page to their own Wikipedia. If you don't even know what language the article is in you could use Language recognition chart, and if that fails, some language identification web site, such as Xerox or What Language Is This? to find out. If you have come here from another Wikipedia, please note on this page what you think should be done with the article.

Deletion
If an article has been listed here for two weeks and is still untranslated, it should be nominated for deletion.  (See also Guide to deletion.)
Articles that are not in English are still subject to all other forms of speedy deletion should they meet the criteria, and can be nominated for deletion by prod or afd should an editor feel they warrant deletion for a reason other than the language it is in, an article not being in English is not itself a criterion for deletion until the two week period has passed. Also, articles in other languages are still subject to blp prod. 

After translation
When a page listed here has been translated, its entry should be removed (or moved to section Cleanup  if the translation needs another pair of eyes).  
There are also procedures to follow at the Talk page of the article itself; see template {{translated page}} and Wikipedia:Translation#How to translate.

Various templates are available to tag the article page needing translator attention, and one template is available for use here at WP:PNT.
The following templates are available to tag articles with translation issues in preparation for listing the article at WP:PNT:
The following templates are available for use at WP:PNT to add an entry linking to the article having the translation issue:
These templates, and other templates relating to translation issues outside the scope of WP:PNT can be found at Wikipedia:Template messages/Translation.

Templates for article pages
One of the following templates should be used at the top of the article page:

Not English
Template {{not English}} (alias: {{notenglish}}) is available
for a page that needs translation in its entirety (so it would be appropriate to delete if not fixed):

Not English section
If there is just a section that needs translation:

Cleanup translation
Template {{cleanup translation}} (alias: {{cleanup-translation}}) is available
if the article has been translated, but needs attention from someone approaching dual fluency in both languages:

Hidden translation
Template {{Hidden translation}} is available
if the article was translated at an earlier point and contained factual errors, while subsequent edits fixed up the English without fixing the errors of fact. The article now looks good and not "machine-translated" anymore, but the original errors of fact are still there, papered over with a facade of good English.

Rough translation
Template {{rough translation}} is available
if the article has been translated, but it looks to be either a machine translation or by someone who doesn't have a good command of the target language, and needs attention from a translator; more than just copyediting is required.

Translate passage
Template {{Translate passage}} is available for articles that are primarily in English, but have a brief section like a quotation, poem, excerpt, etc. in another language, that needs translation.

Templates for use here
Once you have tagged the article page with one of the templates above, the banner that appears will provide instructions on using a template to add an entry to the list of pages needing translation (titled "Pages for consideration") using the {{Needtrans}} template or the translation cleanup section (titled "Translated pages that could still use some cleanup") :

Needtrans
Template {{Needtrans}} is available for use in the list of pages needing translation.
Follow instructions at the expanded banner generated by {{tlx|Not English]] to subst template {{Needtrans}} onto the page at the bottom of the cleanup section.  Sample invocations:
Please consider also placing
on the talk page of the author.

This page appears to have started as a poor-quality machine translation of the Japanese Wikipedia page ja:神道の歴史.  The article structure is largely intact so far as I've checked, so it's still pretty easy to align sentence-by-sentence.  Of chief concern that I've noticed is mistranslated / misromanized titles, such as in the #Theorizing_Shinto_and_the_Honji_Suijaku_Theory section where we see things like 三角柏伝記 mis-rendered as "Sankaku Kashiwa Denki" instead of the expected Mitsuno Kashiwa Denki, or 中臣祓訓解 appearing as "Chuushin Horaikunka" instead of the expected Nakatomi no Harae Kunge.  That said, the whole piece should be reviewed and cleaned up -- even a cursory skim reveals wording, continuity, punctuation, and grammar mistakes, mostly further down the article -- it seems that the first few paragraphs have received the most attention.  ‑‑ Eiríkr Útlendi │Tala við mig 22:55, 15 March 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply]

According to the talk page this isn't so much a bad translation as bad OCR of the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica, but it does need serious help, preferably from someone familiar with Central Asia and the Silk Road. I've just spent a good part of a day adding references and identifying the beginning and end of sentences, but it needs much much more. The references do definitely seem to be out there, fwiw; everything I tried to verify could easily be referenced. I am interested and will probably be back, but after we're done with the sentence forensics big chunks of it will probably need to be re-written for readabily as it is difficult to follow which usurper imprisoned the rightful heir of which country, etc. Elinruby (talk) 05:36, 11 December 2022 (UTC)Reply[reply]

The initial language of this article was Portuguese. English reads well, but translation should be double-checked for false friends and similar mistakes - I see "strike of academics" that presumably should be "teachers' strike", for example asilvering (talk) 06:25, 18 March 2023 (UTC)Reply[reply]

The initial language of this article was Polish. The translation from Polish is rough. The article is translated from the Polish WP article, and without transferring the refs.
