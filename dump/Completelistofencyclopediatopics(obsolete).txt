This page has been rendered obsolete (indeed, harmful) by updates to Wikipedia software and the growth of Wikipedia in general.
See also the most basic encyclopedia article topics or Wikipedia:List_of_encyclopedia_topics for an alternative method of finding subject areas to work on.
Please do not delete this page, under any circumstances - it, along with associated talk and subpages (and, more critically, their histories), contain important documentation of the early days of Wikipedia - documentation which will (someday) be very important to historians. See the talk page for more.
