Telefónica has received several fines due to convictions over unfair competition, abuse of its position as dominant provider, and antitrust violations through the Commission of Telecommunications, European Commission, and Spanish tribunals. These fines include:
As of 2008, Telefónica had in court two more fines, with a value of 793 million euros.[59]
On 5 July 2007, the European Commission ordered Telefónica to pay a record antitrust fine of almost €152 million for activities in the Spanish broadband market which, according to European Union competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, "harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy."
Several consumer groups in Spain have reported unnecessary delays in cancelling Telefónica's ADSL service. These consumer groups also claim that services continue to be billed after being cancelled and that service cancellation requests are ignored.[60]
This has led Spanish people to organize themselves in consumer groups such as the  "Asociación de Internautas" and user communities like "Bandaancha" in order to defend themselves from Telefónica's abuses and to give support and help to each other in their various complaints about Telefónica's unfair practices.
The practices are claimed to include the complex process involved in cancelling lines.[61]
These line cancellation procedures are justified by Telefónica as a way of "defending customers against hoaxes." Furthermore, in areas where ADSL lines are scarce, there are also reports of customers who claim to have had their service cancelled or inexplicably transferred to another customer although they have paid their bills.[62]
This practice is considered by some to be used by Telefónica in certain areas of Spain where there are few broadband connections.

Additionally, he said that Telefónica will seek to push its own content.[64]
