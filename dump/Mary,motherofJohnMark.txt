Mary,motherofJohnMark,
Mary, mother of John Mark is mentioned in Acts 12:12,[1] which says that, after his escape from prison, Peter went to her house: "When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying."[2] This seems to be the only mention of her in the Bible. From this it would appear that Mary's house was a place of gathering for the Apostles and other Christians.
