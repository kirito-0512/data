BlackRussian,
The Black Russian is a cocktail of vodka and coffee liqueur. It contains 50 ml vodka and 20 ml coffee liqueur, per IBA specified ingredients.[1]
The drink is made by pouring the vodka and coffee liqueur over ice cubes or cracked ice in an old-fashioned glass and stirring.[2] The Black Russian is often garnished with a lemon slice and a Luxardo maraschino cherry on a stick.[3]
The Black Russian cocktail first appeared in 1949 and is ascribed to Gustave Tops, a Belgian barman, who created it at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels in honor of Perle Mesta, then United States Ambassador to Luxembourg.[4] The cocktail owes its name to the use of vodka, a typical Russian spirit, and the blackness of the coffee liqueur.
