Freestyleskiingatthe2002WinterOlympics,

Four freestyle skiing events were held at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, at the venue in Deer Valley.  There were both men's and women's competition in both aerials and moguls events.  In moguls, the athletes ski down a slope littered with moguls (bumps), attempting to get down in as fast a time as possible while also attempting to get points for technique and their two aerial jumps during the course.  The aerials events consisted of two jumps, which were judged by air, form and landing.[1]
Twenty-one nations competed in the freestyle skiing events at Salt Lake City.
