Fujiwara no Yoshifusa (藤原 良房, 804 – October 7, 872), also known as Somedono no Daijin or Shirakawa-dono, was a Japanese statesman, courtier and politician during the Heian period.[1]
When Yoshifusa's grandson was enthroned as Emperor Seiwa, Yoshifusa assumed the role of regent (sesshō) for the young monarch.[1]  He was the first sesshō in Japanese history who was not himself of imperial rank; and he was the first of a series of regents from the Fujiwara clan.[1]
He was a minister during the reigns of Emperor Ninmyō, Emperor Montoku and Emperor Seiwa.[1]
Yoshifusa conceived the programme of boy-sovereigns with Fujiwara regents; and his adopted son, Mototsune, carried out the plans.[6]
This member of the Fujiwara clan was the son of Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu.[1]  Yoshifusa's brothers were  Fujiwara no Nagayoshi,[7] Fujiwara no Yoshisuke[8] and Fujiwara no Yoshikado.[9]
He was married to Minamoto no Kiyohime (源 潔姫), daughter of Emperor Saga.
They had only one daughter.
He adopted his brother Nagara's third son.
Yoshifusa is referred to as Chūjin Kō (忠仁公) (posthumous title was Daijō Daijin).
