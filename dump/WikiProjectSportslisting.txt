WikiProjectSportslisting,
First, an important note for everyone to remember:
A few Wikipedians have gotten together to make some suggestions about how we might organize data in articles about all known sports.  These are only suggestions, things to give you focus and to get you going, and you shouldn't feel obligated in the least to follow them. But if you don't know what to write or where to begin, following the below guidelines may be helpful. Mainly, we just want you to write articles!
WikiProject Sports Listing
This WikiProject aims primarily to catalogue all known sports.
The parent of this WikiProject is the WikiProject Sports.
No descendant WikiProjects have been defined.
The similar WikiProjects are WikiProject Sports Team Listing and WikiProject Olympics.

Note that there are many contributors to the individual sports articles
There should be an individual entry for each sport.  Defining what is a sport and what is an event is still open, 
but as a general rule if it's controlled by one federation, it's one sport (though that's not always true).  
Individual events or subdisciplines within a sport should get their own page, if there is sufficient specific information to warrant
it.  It is not yet clear whether subpages are an appropriate home for events of a particular sport.
At a minimum, an entry for an individual sport should describe its origins and major countries where it is currently played, 
give a basic description of the playing arena and any distinctive equipment, describe the basic conduct of the game (team size
and composition, object of the game, major rules, and conduct of a competition, and tactics (if applicable)), give some idea as to its popularity with
spectators and/or participants (for instance, sport fishing is a popular participant sport with virtually no spectator
appeal, gymnastics is a popular spectator sport which comparatively few people compete in, and golf is popular with both
participants and spectators), and possibly give some insight into the physical and mental characteristics necessary to succeed
at the sport at the elite level (for instance, table tennis players require extremely swift reaction times, whilst weightlifting
requires sheer brute strength).
Of course, additional information about the sport (including elite players (or indeed coaches), information about major competitions in that, 
more elaborate descriptions of certain facets of the sport (for example, pages on leg spin), is highly desirable.
Sports can be classified into the following categories which are also to be listed on the main sports page.  A specific sport may fit into more than one category.
See also this example on dividing a topic into a hierarchy.
The WikiProject idea is still in the proposal stage. Please read Wikipedia:WikiProject proposal for further information.
