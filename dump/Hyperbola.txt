Hyperbola,
In mathematics, a hyperbola (/haɪˈpɜːrbələ/ (listen); pl. hyperbolas or hyperbolae /-liː/ (listen); adj. hyperbolic /ˌhaɪpərˈbɒlɪk/ (listen)) is a type of smooth curve lying in a plane, defined by its geometric properties or by equations for which it is the solution set.  A hyperbola has two pieces, called connected components or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite bows.  The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of conic section, formed by the intersection of a plane and a double cone.  (The other conic sections are the parabola and the ellipse. A circle is a special case of an ellipse.) If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones, then the conic is a hyperbola.
Hyperbolas arise in many ways:
and so on.
Each branch of the hyperbola has two arms which become straighter (lower curvature) further out from the center of the hyperbola. Diagonally opposite arms, one from each branch, tend in the limit to a common line, called the asymptote of those two arms. So there are two asymptotes, whose intersection is at the center of symmetry of the hyperbola, which can be thought of as the mirror point about which each branch reflects to form the other branch. In the case of the curve 



y
(
x
)
=
1

/

x


{\displaystyle y(x)=1/x}

 the asymptotes are the two coordinate axes.[2]
Hyperbolas share many of the ellipses' analytical properties such as eccentricity, focus, and directrix. Typically the correspondence can be made with nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other mathematical objects have their origin in the hyperbola, such as hyperbolic paraboloids (saddle surfaces), hyperboloids ("wastebaskets"), hyperbolic geometry (Lobachevsky's celebrated non-Euclidean geometry), hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and gyrovector spaces (a geometry proposed for use in both relativity and quantum mechanics which is not Euclidean).
The word "hyperbola" derives from the Greek ὑπερβολή, meaning "over-thrown" or "excessive", from which the English term hyperbole also derives. Hyperbolae were discovered by Menaechmus in his investigations of the problem of doubling the cube, but were then called sections of obtuse cones.[3] The term hyperbola is believed to have been coined by Apollonius of Perga (c. 262–c. 190 BC) in his definitive work on the conic sections, the Conics.[4]
The names of the other two general conic sections, the ellipse and the parabola, derive from the corresponding Greek words for "deficient" and "applied"; all three names are borrowed from earlier Pythagorean terminology which referred to a comparison of the side of rectangles of fixed area with a given line segment. The rectangle could be "applied" to the segment (meaning, have an equal length), be shorter than the segment or exceed the segment.[5]
A hyperbola can be defined geometrically as a set of points (locus of points) in the Euclidean plane:
The midpoint 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 of the line segment joining the foci is called the center of the hyperbola.[7] The line through the foci is called the major axis. It contains the vertices 




V

1


,

V

2




{\displaystyle V_{1},V_{2}}

, which have distance  



a


{\displaystyle a}

 to the center. The distance 



c


{\displaystyle c}

 of the foci to the center is called the focal distance or linear eccentricity. The quotient 






c
a





{\displaystyle {\tfrac {c}{a}}}

 is the eccentricity 



e


{\displaystyle e}

.
The equation

a


{\displaystyle \left|\left|PF_{2}\right|-\left|PF_{1}\right|\right|=2a}

 can be viewed in a different way (see diagram):
If 




c

2




{\displaystyle c_{2}}

 is the circle with midpoint 




F

2




{\displaystyle F_{2}}

 and radius 



2
a


{\displaystyle 2a}

, then the distance of a point 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 of the right branch to the circle 




c

2




{\displaystyle c_{2}}

 equals the distance to the focus 




F

{\displaystyle F_{1}}

:

{\displaystyle |PF_{1}|=|Pc_{2}|.}







c

2




{\displaystyle c_{2}}

 is called  the circular directrix (related to focus 




F

2




{\displaystyle F_{2}}

) of the hyperbola.[8][9] In order to get the left branch of the hyperbola, one has to use the circular directrix related to 




F

1




{\displaystyle F_{1}}

. This property should not be confused with the definition of a hyperbola with help of a directrix (line) below.
If the xy-coordinate system is rotated about the origin by the angle 



+

45

∘




{\displaystyle +45^{\circ }}

  and new coordinates 



ξ
,
η


{\displaystyle \xi ,\eta }

 are assigned, then 



x

η

,

y
=




−
ξ
+
η


2






{\displaystyle x={\tfrac {\xi +\eta }{\sqrt {2}}},\;y={\tfrac {-\xi +\eta }{\sqrt {2}}}}

.
The rectangular hyperbola 








x

−

a

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {x^{2}-y^{2}}{a^{2}}}=1}

 (whose semi-axes are equal) has the new equation

=

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {2\xi \eta }{a^{2}}}=1}

{\displaystyle \eta ={\tfrac {a^{2}/2}{\xi }}\ .}


Thus, in an xy-coordinate system the graph of a function 



f
:

{\displaystyle f:x\mapsto {\tfrac {A}{x}},\;A>0\;,}

 with equation

{\displaystyle y={\frac {A}{x}}\;,A>0\;,}

 is a rectangular hyperbola entirely in the first and third quadrants with
A rotation of the original hyperbola by 



−

45

∘




{\displaystyle -45^{\circ }}

 results in a rectangular hyperbola entirely in the second and fourth quadrants, with the same asymptotes, center, semi-latus rectum, radius of curvature at the vertices, linear eccentricity, and eccentricity as for the case of 



+

45

∘




{\displaystyle +45^{\circ }}

 rotation, with equation




y
=
−


A

,
 
 
A

,


{\displaystyle y=-{\frac {A}{x}}\;,~~A>0\;,}


Shifting the hyperbola with equation 



y
=


A

,
 
A
≠
0
 
,


{\displaystyle y={\frac {A}{x}},\ A\neq 0\ ,}

 so that the new center is 



(

c

0


,

d

0


)


{\displaystyle (c_{0},d_{0})}

, yields the new equation




y
=


A

x
−

c

+

d

0



,


{\displaystyle y={\frac {A}{x-c_{0}}}+d_{0}\;,}


and the new asymptotes are 



x
=

c

0




{\displaystyle x=c_{0}}

 and 



y
=

d

0




{\displaystyle y=d_{0}}

. The shape parameters 



a
,
b
,
p
,
c
,
e


{\displaystyle a,b,p,c,e}

 remain unchanged.
The two lines at distance 



d
=



a

2


c




{\textstyle d={\frac {a^{2}}{c}}}

 from the center and parallel to the minor axis are called directrices of the hyperbola (see diagram).
For an arbitrary point 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 of the hyperbola the quotient of the distance to one focus and to the corresponding directrix (see diagram) is equal to the eccentricity:

{\displaystyle {\frac {|PF_{1}|}{|Pl_{1}|}}={\frac {|PF_{2}|}{|Pl_{2}|}}=e={\frac {c}{a}}\,.}


The proof for the pair

{\displaystyle F_{1},l_{1}}

 follows from the fact that

{\displaystyle |PF_{1}|^{2}-{\frac {c^{2}}{a^{2}}}|Pl_{1}|^{2}=0\ .}


The second case is proven analogously.
The inverse statement is also true and can be used to define a hyperbola (in a manner similar to the definition of a parabola):
For any point 



F


{\displaystyle F}

 (focus), any line 



l


{\displaystyle l}

 (directrix) not through 



F


{\displaystyle F}

 and any real number 



e

}



{\displaystyle H=\left\{P\,{\Biggr |}\,{\frac {|PF|}{|Pl|}}=e\right\}}


is a hyperbola.
(The choice 



e
=
1


{\displaystyle e=1}

 yields a parabola and if 



e
<
1


{\displaystyle e<1}

 an ellipse.)
Let 



F
=
(
f
,
0
)
,
 
e
>
0


{\displaystyle F=(f,0),\ e>0}

 and assume 



(
0
,
0
)


{\displaystyle (0,0)}

 is a point on the curve.
The directrix 



l


{\displaystyle l}

 has equation 



x
=
−



f
e





{\displaystyle x=-{\tfrac {f}{e}}}

. With 



P
=
(
x
,
y
)


{\displaystyle P=(x,y)}

, the relation

P
F


|


2


=

e

P
l

2




{\displaystyle |PF|^{2}=e^{2}|Pl|^{2}}

 produces the equations
The substitution 



p
=
f
(
1
+
e
)


{\displaystyle p=f(1+e)}

 yields

−
1
)
+
2
p
x
−

y

2


=
0.


{\displaystyle x^{2}(e^{2}-1)+2px-y^{2}=0.}


This is the equation of an ellipse (



e
<
1


{\displaystyle e<1}

) or a parabola (



e
=
1


{\displaystyle e=1}

) or a hyperbola (



e
>
1


{\displaystyle e>1}

). All of these non-degenerate conics have, in common, the origin as a vertex (see diagram).
If 



e
>
1


{\displaystyle e>1}

, introduce new parameters 



a
,
b


{\displaystyle a,b}

 so that 




e

−

=




b

a

,

 and 

 
p
=




b

2


a





{\displaystyle e^{2}-1={\tfrac {b^{2}}{a^{2}}},{\text{ and }}\ p={\tfrac {b^{2}}{a}}}

, and then the equation above becomes

{\displaystyle {\frac {(x+a)^{2}}{a^{2}}}-{\frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}}=1\,,}

 (see diagram) and focus

 are inverse with respect to the circle inversion at circle 




x

=

a

2




{\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}}

 (in diagram green). Hence point 




E

1




{\displaystyle E_{1}}

 can be constructed using the theorem of Thales (not shown in the diagram). The directrix 




l

1




{\displaystyle l_{1}}

 is the perpendicular to line 







F

1



F

2



¯




{\displaystyle {\overline {F_{1}F_{2}}}}

 through point 




E

1




{\displaystyle E_{1}}

.
Alternative construction of 




E

1




{\displaystyle E_{1}}

: Calculation shows, that point 




E

1




{\displaystyle E_{1}}

 is the intersection of the asymptote with its perpendicular through 




F

1




{\displaystyle F_{1}}

 (see diagram).
The intersection of an upright double cone by a plane not through the vertex with slope greater than the slope of the lines on the cone is a hyperbola (see diagram: red curve). In order to prove the defining property of a hyperbola (see above) one uses two Dandelin spheres 




d

,

d

2




{\displaystyle d_{1},d_{2}}

, which are spheres that touch the cone along circles 




c

c

{\displaystyle c_{2}}

 and the intersecting (hyperbola) plane at points 




F

1




{\displaystyle F_{1}}

 and 




F

2




{\displaystyle F_{2}}

. It turns out: 




F

1


,

F

2




{\displaystyle F_{1},F_{2}}

 are the foci of the hyperbola.
The definition of a hyperbola by its foci and its circular directrices (see above) can be used for drawing an arc of it with help of pins, a string and a ruler:[10]
The following method to construct single points of a hyperbola relies on the Steiner generation of a non degenerate conic section:
For the generation of points of the hyperbola

. Let 



P

{\displaystyle P=(x_{0},y_{0})}

 be a point of the hyperbola and

)


{\displaystyle A=(a,y_{0}),B=(x_{0},0)}

. The line segment

 is divided into n equally-spaced segments and this division is projected parallel with the diagonal 



A

{\displaystyle {\overline {AP}}}

 (see diagram). The parallel projection is part of the projective mapping between the pencils at

S

{\displaystyle S_{1}A_{i}}

Remarks:

 uses the inscribed angle theorem for hyperbolas:
Analogous to the inscribed angle theorem for circles one gets the

 (see diagram) the following statement is true:
The four points are on a hyperbola with equation

{\displaystyle y={\tfrac {a}{x-b}}+c}

 if and only if the angles at

The proof can be derived by straightforward calculation. If the points are on a hyperbola, one can assume the hyperbola's equation is

 is the area of the rhombus generated by

. The area of a rhombus is equal to one half of the product of its diagonals. The diagonals are the semi-axes 



a

{\displaystyle a,b}

 of the hyperbola. Hence:
The reciprocation of a circle B in a circle C always yields a conic section such as a hyperbola. The process of "reciprocation in a circle C" consists of replacing every line and point in a geometrical figure with their corresponding pole and polar, respectively. The pole of a line is the inversion of its closest point to the circle C, whereas the polar of a point is the converse, namely, a line whose closest point to C is the inversion of the point.
The eccentricity of the conic section obtained by reciprocation is the ratio of the distances between the two circles' centers to the radius r of reciprocation circle C. If B and C represent the points at the centers of the corresponding circles, then




e
=




B
C

¯

r


.


{\displaystyle e={\frac {\overline {BC}}{r}}.}


Since the eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than one, the center B must lie outside of the reciprocating circle C.
This definition implies that the hyperbola is both the locus of the poles of the tangent lines to the circle B, as well as the envelope of the polar lines of the points on B. Conversely, the circle B is the envelope of polars of points on the hyperbola, and the locus of poles of tangent lines to the hyperbola. Two tangent lines to B have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center C of the reciprocation circle C; the polars of the corresponding tangent points on B are the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The two branches of the hyperbola correspond to the two parts of the circle B that are separated by these tangent points.
A hyperbola can also be defined as a second-degree equation in the Cartesian coordinates (x, y) in the plane,

If Cartesian coordinates are introduced such that the origin is the center of the hyperbola and the x-axis is the major axis, then the hyperbola is called east-west-opening and

This equation is called the canonical form of a hyperbola, because any hyperbola, regardless of its orientation relative to the Cartesian axes and regardless of the location of its center, can be transformed to this form by a change of variables, giving a hyperbola that is congruent to the original (see below).
The axes of symmetry or principal axes are the transverse axis (containing the segment of length 2a with endpoints at the vertices) and the conjugate axis (containing the segment of length 2b perpendicular to the transverse axis and with midpoint at the hyperbola's center).[19] As opposed to an ellipse, a hyperbola has only two vertices: 



(
a
,
0
)
,

(
−
a
,
0
)


{\displaystyle (a,0),\;(-a,0)}

. The two points 



(
0
,
b
)
,

(
0
,
−
b
)


{\displaystyle (0,b),\;(0,-b)}

 on the conjugate axes are not on the hyperbola.
It follows from the equation that the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both of the coordinate axes and hence symmetric with respect to the origin.
For a hyperbola in the above canonical form, the eccentricity is given by




e
=


1
+



b

Two hyperbolas are geometrically similar to each other – meaning that they have the same shape, so that one can be transformed into the other by rigid left and right movements, rotation, taking a mirror image, and scaling (magnification) – if and only if they have the same eccentricity.

A particular tangent line distinguishes the hyperbola from the other conic sections.[22] Let f be the distance from the vertex V (on both the hyperbola and its axis through the two foci) to the nearer focus. Then the distance, along a line perpendicular to that axis, from that focus to a point P on the hyperbola is greater than 2f. The tangent to the hyperbola at P intersects that axis at point Q at an angle ∠PQV of greater than 45°.
In the case 



a
=
b


{\displaystyle a=b}

 the hyperbola is called rectangular (or equilateral), because its asymptotes intersect at right angles. For this case, the linear eccentricity is

Just as the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of the unit circle, so also the hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the unit hyperbola, as shown in this diagram.  In a unit circle, the angle (in radians) is equal to twice the area of the circular sector which that angle subtends.  The analogous hyperbolic angle is likewise defined as twice the area of a hyperbolic sector.
Let 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 be twice the area between the

The midpoints of parallel chords of a hyperbola lie on a line through the center (see diagram).
The points of any chord may lie on different branches of the hyperbola.
The proof of the property on midpoints is best done for the hyperbola

/

{\displaystyle y=1/x}

. Because any hyperbola is an affine image of the hyperbola 



y

 (see section below) and an affine transformation preserves parallelism and midpoints of line segments, the property is true for all hyperbolas:

Consequence: for any pair of points

Q


{\displaystyle P,Q}

 of a chord there exists a skew reflection with an axis (set of fixed points) passing through the center of the hyperbola, which exchanges the points 



P

Q


{\displaystyle P,Q}

 and leaves the hyperbola (as a whole) fixed. A skew reflection is a generalization of an ordinary reflection across a line 



m


{\displaystyle m}

, where all point-image pairs are on a line perpendicular to 



m


{\displaystyle m}

.
Because a skew reflection leaves the hyperbola fixed, the pair of asymptotes is fixed, too. Hence the midpoint 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 of a chord 



P
Q


{\displaystyle PQ}

 divides the related line segment 





P

If the chord degenerates into a tangent, then the touching point divides the line segment between the asymptotes in two halves.

Such a relation between points and lines generated by a conic is called pole-polar relation or just polarity. The pole is the point, the polar the line. See Pole and polar.
By calculation one checks the following properties of the pole-polar relation of the hyperbola:

Several other curves can be derived from the hyperbola by inversion, the so-called inverse curves of the hyperbola. If the center of inversion is chosen as the hyperbola's own center, the inverse curve is the lemniscate of Bernoulli; the lemniscate is also the envelope of circles centered on a rectangular hyperbola and passing through the origin. If the center of inversion is chosen at a focus or a vertex of the hyperbola, the resulting inverse curves are a limaçon or a strophoid, respectively.

where the foci are located at a distance c from the origin on the x-axis, and where θ is the angle of the asymptotes with the x-axis. Every hyperbola in this family is orthogonal to every ellipse that shares the same foci. This orthogonality may be shown by a conformal map of the Cartesian coordinate system w = z + 1/z, where z= x + iy are the original Cartesian coordinates, and w=u + iv are those after the transformation.
Other orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate systems involving hyperbolas may be obtained by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping w = z2 transforms the Cartesian coordinate system into two families of orthogonal hyperbolas.
Besides providing a uniform description of circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, conic sections can also be understood as a natural model of the geometry of perspective in the case where the scene being viewed consists of circles, or more generally an ellipse. The viewer is typically a camera or the human eye and the image of the scene a central projection onto an image plane, that is, all projection rays pass a fixed point O, the center. The lens plane is a plane parallel to the image plane at the lens O.
The image of a circle c is
(Special positions where the circle plane contains point O are omitted.)
These results can be understood if one recognizes that the projection process can be seen in two steps: 1) circle c and point O generate a cone which is 2) cut by the image plane, in order to generate the image.
One sees a hyperbola whenever catching sight of a portion of a circle cut by one's lens plane. The inability to see very much of the arms of the visible branch, combined with the complete absence of the second branch, makes it virtually impossible for the human visual system to recognize the connection with hyperbolas.
Hyperbolas may be seen in many sundials. On any given day, the sun revolves in a circle on the celestial sphere, and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground over the course of a day (this path is called the declination line). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a pelekinon by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.
A hyperbola is the basis for solving multilateration problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points — or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from a LORAN or GPS transmitters. Conversely, a homing beacon or any transmitter can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations; such techniques may be used to track objects and people. In particular, the set of possible positions of a point that has a distance difference of 2a from two given points is a hyperbola of vertex separation 2a whose foci are the two given points.
The path followed by any particle in the classical Kepler problem is a conic section. In particular, if the total energy E of the particle is greater than zero (that is, if the particle is unbound), the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. This property is useful in studying atomic and sub-atomic forces by scattering high-energy particles; for example, the Rutherford experiment demonstrated the existence of an atomic nucleus by examining the scattering of alpha particles from gold atoms. If the short-range nuclear interactions are ignored, the atomic nucleus and the alpha particle interact only by a repulsive Coulomb force, which satisfies the inverse square law requirement for a Kepler problem.

As shown first by Apollonius of Perga, a hyperbola can be used to trisect any angle, a well studied problem of geometry.

 as directrix and B as a focus. Let P be the intersection (upper) of the hyperbola with the circle. Angle POB trisects angle AOB.
To prove this, reflect the line segment OP about the line

 obtaining the point P' as the image of P. Segment AP' has the same length as segment BP due to the reflection, while segment PP' has the same length as segment BP due to the eccentricity of the hyperbola. As OA, OP', OP and OB are all radii of the same circle (and so, have the same length), the triangles OAP', OPP' and OPB are all congruent. Therefore, the angle has been trisected, since 3×POB = AOB.[26]
In portfolio theory, the locus of mean-variance efficient portfolios (called the efficient frontier) is the upper half of the east-opening branch of a hyperbola drawn with the portfolio return's standard deviation plotted horizontally and its expected value plotted vertically; according to this theory, all rational investors would choose a portfolio characterized by some point on this locus.
In biochemistry and pharmacology, the Hill equation and Hill-Langmuir equation respectively describe biological responses and the formation of protein–ligand complexes as functions of ligand concentration. They are both rectangular hyperbolae.
Hyperbolas appear as plane sections of the following quadrics:
Elliptic cone
Hyperbolic cylinder
Hyperbolic paraboloid
Hyperboloid of one sheet
Hyperboloid of two sheets
