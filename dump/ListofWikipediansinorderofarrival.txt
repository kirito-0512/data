ListofWikipediansinorderofarrival,
This is a rough, self-administered list of Wikipedians in order of arrival. The list exists only to satisfy general Wikipedian interest. This list is not intended to create some sort of hierarchy.  In other words, we Wikipedians abhor the idea that the amount of time spent working on this website is any sort of indication of how well one can write an encyclopedia article. Indeed, we distinguish ourselves by our ability to write good articles, which is what really matters. We ought to do our best to underemphasize seniority, which can be used, often illegitimately, as a way of deciding whom to accord how much respect. Of course, sometimes how long someone has been here does bear on, for example, how well they understand Wikipedia policy and why Wikipedia works as it does. But it doesn't bear on much else.
See Wikipedia:Missing Wikipedians for those who left Wikipedia.
This list is in descending order (most recent at the top).


The archives are listed by year. Feel free to continue adding names/yourself to the archives.
