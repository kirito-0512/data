Nepal is a landlocked mountainous country where transportation is difficult due to the terrain.

The Economic Survey 2014-15 released by the Ministry of Finance (Nepal), shows that the country has a total road network of 80,078 kilometres (49,758 mi), which includes 26,935 kilometres (16,737 mi) of roads constructed and being maintained by the Department of Roads and 53,143 kilometres (33,022 mi) of roads constructed by local government bodies.[1]

Nepal Government Railway operated a short narrow gauge railway from 1927 to 1965. Presently in 2022, there are two operational railway lines in the country, both of which connect Nepal with India: the Raxaul–Sirsiya and the Jainagar–Janakpur. The former is a 6 km (3.7 mi) line from Raxaul, India to Sirsiya Inland Container Depot (or dry port) near Birgunj, Nepal, and is primarily used for freight transport.[4] It allows container traffic to be imported to Nepal through the Sirsiya dry port container depot.[5] The latter is a 51 km (32 mi) line from Jaynagar, India to Janakpur, Nepal, and is used primarily for passenger transport.[6]
Nepal and India had agreed to construct 8 different India–Nepal cross-border rail lines, this includes linking Raxaul with Kathmandu, during Prime Minister KP Oli's visit to India.[7] A team of technical officers visited Kathmandu to study the proposed railway from Raxaul to Kathmandu and they have stated that a feasibility study of the project would begin. They have already identified Chobhar as the terminus of the 113 km-long line. [8]
China–Nepal railway is a planned line through Kathmandu, linking India with Lhasa in Tibet, has been proposed by the KP Oli government. In November 2017, Chinese media reported the arrival of a delegation of Chinese railway experts in Nepal. They discussed the possibility of a rail connection between China and Nepal.[9] In August 2018, the two sides reached an agreement on construction details of the railway.[10][11]
