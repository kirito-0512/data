Mattel,

Mattel, Inc. (/məˈtɛl/ mə-TEL) is an American multinational toy manufacturing and entertainment company founded in Los Angeles by Harold Matson and the husband-and-wife duo of Elliot and Ruth Handler[8] in January 1945 and currently headquartered in El Segundo, California. Having presence in 35 countries and territories and its products sold in more than 150 countries,[9] Mattel operates through three business segments: North America, International and American Girl.[10]
It is the world's second largest toy maker in terms of revenue, after The Lego Group.[11][12] Two of its historic and most valuable brands, Barbie and Hot Wheels, were respectively named the top global toy property and the top-selling global toy of the year for 2020[13] and 2021[14] by The NPD Group, a global information research company.
Businessman Harold "Matt" Matson and the husband-and-wife duo of Elliot and Ruth Handler founded Mattel as Mattel Creations in January 1945 in a garage in Los Angeles.[15][16] The company name chosen is a portmanteau of the surname of Matson and first name of Elliot, with former chairman and CEO Bob Eckert revealing at a 2013 Christmas Day Peninsula Seniors lecture that the founders, according to Elliot, couldn't fit Ruth's name into that of their company.[17] The company began selling picture frames and later dollhouse furniture out of the scraps from those frames. Matson sold his share and stake to the Handlers due to poor health the following year, with Handler's wife, Ruth taking over his stake.[18] In 1947, the company had its first successful toy, a ukulele called "Uke-A-Doodle".[16]
The company was incorporated in Hawthorne, California in 1948.[18] In 1950, the Magic 8-Ball, currently owned by Mattel themselves, was invented by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman.[19] Mattel started television advertisement when it became the first sponsor of the Mickey Mouse Club TV series.[20] The Fisher-Price Corn Popper, and the Xylophone was released in 1957.[21][22] Mattel would ultimately acquire Fisher-Price on August 20, 1993.[23] The Barbie doll debuted on March 9, 1959, going on to become the company's best-selling toy in history.[24] In 1960, Mattel introduced Chatty Cathy, a talking doll that was voiced by June Foray and revolutionized the toy industry, leading to pull-string talking dolls and toys flooding the market throughout the 1960s and 1970s.[18][25] In 1961, Mattel introduced the Ken doll.[26] The company went public in 1960 and became listed on the New York Stock Exchange 3 years later. Mattel also acquired a number of like-minded companies during the 1960s (see table to your right on a desktop and below for mobile computers).[18]
The Barbie Dreamhouse made with cardboard and paper made its debut in 1962,[27] when also the Astronaut Barbie, the first of many space-themed iterations of the doll, was introduced.[28]In 1965, the company built on its success with the Chatty Cathy doll to introduce the See 'n Say talking toy, spawning a line of products.[29] Barbie traveled to the moon four years before Neil Armstrong.[30] In 1967, Mattel released another toy astronaut, Major Matt Mason.[31]
On May 18, 1968, Hot Wheels was released to the market.[18] Hot Wheels was invented by a team of Mattel inventors, which included a rocket scientist and a car designer.[32][33] That year also saw another doll release, this time, Christie, Barbie's friend and the first black doll,[34] which in the following years and decades would spawn an endless line of Barbie-themed and branded family and friends. In 1969, Mattel changed the Mattel Creations and the "Mattel, Inc. – Toymakers" marketing brands to just Mattel and launched the iconic "red sun" logo with the Mattel wordmark in all capitals for better identity. In 1970, Hot Wheels forged a sponsorship agreement with drag racing drivers Don “The Snake” Prudhomme and Tom “The Mongoose” McEwen.[35] In addition to other marketing measures, the two racers’ cars, a yellow Barracuda and a red Duster, were reproduced as Hot Wheels toys.[35]
In May 1970, Mattel formed a joint venture film production company "Radnitz/Mattel Productions" with producer Robert B. Radnitz,[36] which would kickstart Mattel's venture into full-time entertainment to accompany its most famed toy TV commercials.[37]
The card game Uno (now stylized as UNO) was invented by Merle Robbins in 1971,[38] and was acquired by Mattel in 1996.[39]
In 1971, Mattel purchased The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus from the Feld family for $40 million, whom Mattel kept as management.[44] Mattel sold the circus corporation by December 1973, despite its profit contributions, as Mattel showed a $29.9 million loss in 1972.[45]
In 1974, an investigation found Mattel guilty of issuing false and misleading financial reports, which led to the banishing of Elliot and Ruth Handler from the company they had founded.[18]
Arthur S. Spear, a then-Mattel vice president, took control of the company in 1975 and returned the company to profitability in two years.[46] In 1978, the Mattel Children's Foundation was founded. Ruth Handler sold her stock in 1980 and finally let loose of the company she co-founded.[18]

Mattel debuted its Electronics line in 1977 with an all-electronic handheld game. Its success led to its expansion with game consoles then the line, eventually becoming getting incorporated in 1982.[47] Mattel Electronics forced Mattel to take a $394 million loss the following and almost filed for bankruptcy.[18]
In 1979, through Feld Productions, Mattel purchased the Holiday on Ice and Ice Follies for $12 million,[48] Also acquired that year was Western Publishing for $120 million in cash and stock.[49] which they would later sell to Richard A. Bernstein in December 4 years later.[49]
In 1980, Mattel introduced the first diverse line of Barbie dolls with a Hispanic doll and the first African-American Barbie (unrelated to Barbie friend Christie),[50][51] which will eventually include iterations of Barbie from more than 40 countries.[51]
In 1982, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe line of action figures was released, which inspired a three-issue comic book mini-series, an animated series and a live-action film.[52]
The Felds bought the circus (and related companies) in 1982 for $22.8 million.[53]
In the early 1980s, Mattel produced video game systems, under its own brands and under license from Nintendo.
In 1985, the company launched the Barbie “We Girls Can Do Anything” TV advertising campaign to encourage girls to believe in themselves.[54] They also released the CEO / Day-to-Night Barbie to celebrate women becoming CEOs.[55] In 1986, Barbie joined the list of famous individuals painted by Andy Warhol.[54]
New York City-based venture capital firms E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co. and Drexel Burnham Lambert invested a couple hundred million dollars in Mattel in 1984 to help the company survive. However, the Masters of the Universe action figure line sales dropped, causing a $115 million loss in 1987.
In the late 1980s, John W. Amerman, who joined Mattel in 1980 as head of its international division, was named the company’s new chairman and improved its financial performance in 1987 by focusing on core brands. It paid off as sales of Barbie dolls and accessories increased from $430 million to almost $1 billion between 1987 and 1992.[18]
Mattel secured licensing and sponsorship rights from The Walt Disney Company for a new line of infant and preschool plush toys in 1988, sponsor attractions and to develop and sell toys at three Disney theme parks.[18] Mattel also negotiated the exclusive rights to sell dolls, stuffed characters and preschool toys based on Disney characters.[18] On January 31, 1988, Mattel shut down its operations in the Philippines and shifted the distribution and sales of Mattel-branded toys and games to Richprime Global, Inc. (formerly Richwell Trading Corporation).
Mattel returned to working with Disney the following year.[18] In 1991, Mattel moved its headquarters from Hawthorne to its current El Segundo site, in Los Angeles County.[56]
In 1992, Mattel created the first President Barbie, claiming that Barbie has run for President 7 times since 1992 and released released an all-female ticket in 2016.[57]
Mattel entered the gaming business in 1992 with the purchase of International Games, creators of UNO and Skip-Bo.[41] Over the next decade, the company would purchase Fisher-Price, Inc. on August 20, 1993, and Tyco Toys, Inc. (owners of the Matchbox and Dinky Toys brands) in 1997. In 1998, Mattel acquired Pleasant Company (creators of the American Girl brand)[18] and Swindon, England-based toymaker Bluebird Toys (along with its most prized property, Polly Pocket). That same year, the first American Girl retail store opened for business in Chicago.[58]
In 1997, the Fisher-Price Little People toys underwent a redesign to look more like real kids with different skin colors, added arms and hands, and greater detail on the face, hair, and clothes.[59] That same year, Mattel acquired View-Master,[60] and Hot Wheels partnered with NASCAR drivers Kyle Petty and Jack Baldwin which led to the production of the first NASCAR-themed vehicles.[61]
In 1998, Mattel donated $25 million to help rebuild UCLA’s children’s hospital, which later renamed the UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital.[62] That was also the year that Barbie was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame[63] and the first Thomas & Friends theme park, Thomas Land, opened in Fujikyu Park in Japan.[64]
Mattel purchased The Learning Company (formerly SoftKey) in 1999 for $3.5 billion, but sold it the following year at a loss. The company had a $430.9 million net loss that year.[18]
Mattel earned the first grant for the Disney Princess doll license in 2000.[65] In December 2000, Mattel sued Danish-Norwegian europop band Aqua, claiming their song "Barbie Girl" violated the Barbie trademark and turned her into a sex object, referring to her as a "blonde bimbo"; in a lawsuit which was rejected two years later.[66]
In 2000, Mattel signed a deal with Warner Bros. to become the master licensee for Harry Potter-branded toys[67] which extended two years later, with Mattel becoming master licensee for Batman, Superman, Justice League and the Looney Tunes toys for all markets except Asia.[68]

American Girl launched its “Girl of the Year” campaign in 2001 to highlight dolls with contemporary stories; each doll is only available for a year.[71]
In 2002, Mattel closed its last factory in the United States, originally part of Fisher-Price, outsourcing production to China, which began a chain of events that led to its distribution of millions of hazardous toys, including ones contaminated with lead.[72] On August 14, 2007, Mattel recalled over 18 million products, with Louise Story of The New York Times in close coverage.[73][74][75] Many of the products had surface coatings that contained more than the U.S. legal limit of .06% lead by weight.[75]  Other toys were recalled because their strong, detachable magnets could endanger children. Mattel re-wrote its policy on magnets, finally issuing a recall in August 2007.[76] The recall included 7.1 million Polly Pocket toys produced before November 2006, 600,000 Barbie and Tanner Playsets, 1 million Doggie Daycare, Shonen Jump's One Piece and thousands of Batman Manga toys due to exposed magnets.[76] In 2009, Mattel paid a $2.3 million fine to the Consumer Products Safety Commission for marketing, importing and selling non-compliant toys.[77] Mattel was noted for its crisis response by several newspaper publications, including PRWeek, the Los Angeles Times, Fortune and Business Management.[78][79][80]
On June 11, 2010, Mattel launched Monster High, a fashion doll line featuring the teenage children of famous and well-known monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein, Cleopatra, Gorgon, Werewolf and The Mummy.[81][82] It led to popularity and cult following success which Mattel translated into two spin-offs, each with a different focus than Monster High; Ever After High in 2013[83][84] and Enchantimals four years later. In 2011, Hot Wheels set a new world-record for a jump made by a four-wheeled vehicle at the 100th anniversary of the Indy 500.[85] The 332 feet jump broke the previous 301 feet record set in 2009.[85]
In early 2010, HIT Entertainment licensed Thomas & Friends to Mattel for toys.[86] Mattel will then agree to purchase HIT Entertainment from Apax Partners on October 24, 2011, for $680 million, excluding its share of the PBS Kids Sprout channel (now Universal Kids), which would be completed on February 1, 2012 for £680m,[87] and be managed under Mattel's Fisher-Price unit.[88] In 2012, Mattel introduced a doll, Ella, to the Barbie line.[89] The doll is bald and was distributed directly through hospitals to children experiencing hair loss due to cancer and other diseases.[89] On October 16, 2013, with reports of high profitability, Mattel launched an in-house film studio, Mattel Playground Productions, through which it produces original films, TV shows, Web series, live events, and games.[90][91]

Mattel added a princess-themed Barbie line in 2010. Barbie sales began plummeting in 2012, thus removing focus from the Disney Princess line. Mattel had only sold Cinderella, Ariel, Belle and the two Frozen princesses (Ana and Elsa) around its last year of the Disney license in early 2016. With these competing lines and an expiration of the brand license at the end of 2015, Disney gave Hasbro a chance to gain the license given their work on Star Wars, which led to a Descendants license. Disney Consumer Products also made an attempt to evolve the brand from "damsels" to "heroines." In September 2014, Disney announced Hasbro as the licensed doll maker for the Disney Princess line starting on January 1, 2016,[65] which Mattel won back on January, 2022 alongside the characters of Frozen.[94][95] The latest collection of dolls were available in January 2023.[96][97]

Former Google executive, Margo Georgiadis, was announced as company CEO on 17 January 2017.[102] On 10 November 10, 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that Hasbro had made a takeover offer for Mattel,[103][104] with Hasbro worth about $11 billion at the time and Mattel, $5 billion,[104] but the latter rejected the offer less than a week later, according to Reuters.[105]
On January 29, 2018, Mattel and Chinese internet technology and video game company NetEase formed a joint venture mobile publishing and development studio, Mattel163, aimed at creating apps based on the former's key brands.[106][107][108] That same year, American Girl released “Create Your Own,” allowing kids to create a doll from scratch and customize everything including facial features, hair, accessories and outfits, and the doll’s favorite places and hobbies.[71]
On April 19, 2018, Mattel named former Maker Studios CEO Ynon Kreiz as chairman and the replacement CEO for outgoing CEO Georgiardis who moved on to head Ancestry.com, effective from April 26, 2018.[109][110] Two months later, the company laid off 2,200 employees partially due to the liquidation of Toys "R" Us in the U.S.[111] Kreiz started reorganization of Mattel which included new board of directors and added that executives having entertainment backgrounds and a global franchise management group had been charged with finding new opportunities in existing markets.[112]

On October 12, 2020, Mattel announced a green-lighting of Season 25 of Thomas & Friends,[142] but retooled instead to launch a traditionally-animated take on it titled Thomas and Friends: All Engines Go!, which began later that year on September 13,[143] thus ending it at 24 series/seasons over 37 years.

Mattel has a long history of media engagement since its foundation with the advertising of products from its brands including Barbie, Monster High and Polly Pocket, but the venture into full-time entertainment began in May, 1970, when it teamed up with producer Robert B. Radnitz to form a joint venture film production company, "Radnitz/Mattel Productions".[36] Masters of the Universe and its lead character He-Man had a cartoon series which released between 1983 and 1985 and was followed by a live-action film in 1987.[149] In 1986, Mattel launched a television syndication unit; MTS Entertainment, headed by John M. Weens, to distribute the Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future syndicated television show.[150]
My Scene, with Mattel's flagship Barbie brand, launched in 2002 and wasted little time in invoking a film franchise of DVD-exclusive/direct-to-DVD CGI-animated films. "Polly Pocket", which was originally founded and designed by Chris Wiggs in 1983 for his daughter Kate as a private toy and from 1989 housed in Bluebird Toys which Mattel acquired in 1998, also followed suit.
With Lionsgate and its acquired and merged companies in Artisan Entertainment and Family Home Entertainment, Mattel had its flagship Barbie brand adapted into a series of successful computer-animated direct-to-video films, which moved to Universal in late 2006 and is, as of 1 September 2021, jointly handled by Mill Creek Entertainment and NCirlce Entertainment, with the latter solely for American retailers.[151][152][153][154][155] Monster High followed Barbie just months after its launch in 2010[156] and many “American Girl” films were made.[156]
