TransportinChad,

Transport infrastructure within Chad is generally poor, especially in the north and east of the country.  River transport is limited to the south-west corner. As of 2011 Chad had no railways though two lines are planned - from the capital to the Sudanese and Cameroonian borders during the wet season, especially in the southern half of the country.  In the north, roads are merely tracks across the desert and land mines continue to present a danger.  Draft animals (horses, donkeys and camels) remain important in much of the country.
Fuel supplies can be erratic, even in the south-west of the country, and are expensive. Elsewhere they are practically non-existent.
As of 2011 Chad had no railways. Two lines were planned to Sudan and Cameroon from the capital, with construction expected to start in 2012.[1] 
No operative lines were listed as of 2019.[2]
In 2021, an ADB study was funded for that rail link from Cameroon to Chad.[3]
As at 2018 Chad had a total of 44,000 km of roads of which approximately 260 km are paved.[2] Some, but not all of the roads in the capital N'Djamena are paved. Outside of N'Djamena there is one paved road which runs from Massakory in the north, through N'Djamena and then south, through the cities of Guélengdeng, Bongor, Kélo and Moundou, with a short spur leading in the direction of Kousseri, Cameroon, near N'Djamena.  Expansion of the road towards Cameroon through Pala and Léré is reportedly in the preparatory stages.[4]
As at 2012, Chari and Logone Rivers were navigable only in wet season (2002).  Both flow northwards, from the south of Chad, into Lake Chad.[2]
Since 2003, a 1,070 km pipeline has been used to export crude oil from the oil fields around Doba to offshore oil-loading facilities on Cameroon's Atlantic coast at Kribi.[5]
The CIA World Factbook however cites only 582 km of pipeline in Chad itself as at 2013.[2]
None (landlocked).
Chad's main routes to the sea are:[citation needed]
In colonial times, the main access was by road to Bangui, in the Central African Republic, then by river boat to Brazzaville, and onwards by rail from Brazzaville to Pointe Noire, on Congo's Atlantic coast. This route is now little used.[6]
There is also a route across Sudan, to the Red Sea, but very little trade goes this way.[citation needed]
Links with Niger, north of Lake Chad, are practically nonexistent; it is easier to reach Niger via Cameroon and Nigeria.[7][citation needed][dead link]
As of 2012[update] Chad had an estimated 58 airports, only 9 of which had paved runways.[8] In 2015, scheduled airlines in Chad carried approximately 28,332 passengers.[9]
