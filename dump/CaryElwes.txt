Ivan Simon Cary Elwes was born on 26 October 1962 in Westminster, London. He is the youngest of three sons of portrait painter Dominic Elwes[6] and interior designer and socialite Tessa Kennedy. Elwes is the brother of artist Damian Elwes[7] and film producers Cassian Elwes and Milica Kastner. His stepfather, Elliott Kastner, was an American film producer and the first American to set up independent film production in the United Kingdom.[6] His paternal grandfather was the portrait painter Simon Elwes,[7] whose own father was the diplomat and tenor Gervase Elwes (1866–1921).[8] Elwes has English, Irish, Scottish, Croatian-Jewish, and Serbian ancestry,[9] the latter two from his maternal grandmother, Daška McLean, whose second husband, Billy McLean, was an operative for Special Operations Executive during World War II.[10][11]
One of Elwes's relatives is the British miser John Elwes, who was the inspiration for Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol (1843), having been referenced by Charles Dickens himself in chapter six of his last completed novel, Our Mutual Friend.[12][13] Elwes himself played five roles in the 2009 film adaptation of A Christmas Carol. Through his maternal grandfather, Elwes is also related to Sir Alexander William "Blackie" Kennedy, one of the first photographers to document the archaeological site of Petra following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.[14]
Elwes was brought up as a Catholic and was an altar boy at Westminster Cathedral.[15] His paternal relatives include such clerics as Dudley Charles Cary-Elwes (1868–1932), the Bishop of Northampton and Abbot Columba Cary-Elwes (Ampleforth Abbey, Saint Louis Abbey). He discussed this in an interview while he was filming the 2005 CBS television film Pope John Paul II, in which he played the young priest Karol Wojtyła.[citation needed]
Elwes's parents divorced when he was four years old.[citation needed] In 1975, when Elwes was 13, his father committed suicide.[citation needed] He was educated at Harrow School,[7] and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.[16] In 1981, he moved to the United States to study acting at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York.[17] While living there, Elwes studied acting at both the Actors Studio[17] and the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute under the tutelage of Al Pacino's mentor, Charlie Laughton (not to be confused with English actor Charles Laughton).[16] As a teenager, he also worked as a production assistant on the films Absolution, Octopussy, and Superman, where he was assigned to Marlon Brando. When Elwes introduced himself to the actor, Brando insisted on calling him "Rocky" after Rocky Marciano.[18]

He was then cast as stable-boy-turned-swashbuckler Westley in Rob Reiner's fantasy-comedy The Princess Bride (1987), which was based on the novel of the same name by William Goldman. It was a modest box office success,[19] but received critical acclaim.  As a result of years of reviews, it earned a score of 97% on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.[20] Since being released on home video and television, the film has become a cult classic.[19]
Initially the studio didn't know how to market it. Was it an adventure? A fantasy? A comedy? A romance? A kids' movie? In the end they sold it as a kids' movie and it largely had to rely on word of mouth ... people tell me they still have their VHS copy that has been passed down from one generation to the next.Elwes continued to work steadily, varying between dramatic roles, such as in the Oscar-winning Glory (1989), and comedic roles, as in Hot Shots!
