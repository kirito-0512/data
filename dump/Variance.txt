Variance,
In probability theory and statistics, variance is the squared deviation from the mean of a random variable. The variance is also often defined as the square of the standard deviation. Variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. It is the second central moment of a distribution, and the covariance of the random variable with itself, and it is often represented by

An advantage of variance as a measure of dispersion is that it is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than other measures of dispersion such as the expected absolute deviation; for example, the variance of a sum of uncorrelated random variables is equal to the sum of their variances. A disadvantage of the variance for practical applications is that, unlike the standard deviation, its units differ from the random variable, which is why the standard deviation is more commonly reported as a measure of dispersion once the calculation is finished.
There are two distinct concepts that are both called "variance". One, as discussed above, is part of a theoretical probability distribution and is defined by an equation. The other variance is a characteristic of a set of observations. When variance is calculated from observations, those observations are typically measured from a real world system. If all possible observations of the system are present then the calculated variance is called the population variance. Normally, however, only a subset is available, and the variance calculated from this is called the sample variance. The variance calculated from a sample is considered an estimate of the full population variance. There are multiple ways to calculate an estimate of the population variance, as discussed in the section below.
The two kinds of variance are closely related. To see how, consider that a theoretical probability distribution can be used as a generator of hypothetical observations. If an infinite number of observations are generated using a distribution, then the sample variance calculated from that infinite set will match the value calculated using the distribution's equation for variance. Variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, and Monte Carlo sampling.
The term variance was first introduced by Ronald Fisher in his 1918 paper The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance:[2]
The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations

In other words, the variance of X is equal to the mean of the square of X minus the square of the mean of X.  This equation should not be used for computations using floating point arithmetic, because it suffers from catastrophic cancellation if the two components of the equation are similar in magnitude.

Conversely, if the variance of a random variable is 0, then it is almost surely a constant. That is, it always has the same value:

Unlike the expected absolute deviation, the variance of a variable has units that are the square of the units of the variable itself.  For example, a variable measured in meters will have a variance measured in meters squared.  For this reason, describing data sets via their standard deviation or root mean square deviation is often preferred over using the variance.  In the dice example the standard deviation is √2.9 ≈ 1.7, slightly larger than the expected absolute deviation of 1.5.
The standard deviation and the expected absolute deviation can both be used as an indicator of the "spread" of a distribution.  The standard deviation is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than the expected absolute deviation, and, together with variance and its generalization covariance, is used frequently in theoretical statistics; however the expected absolute deviation tends to be more robust as it is less sensitive to outliers arising from measurement anomalies or an unduly heavy-tailed distribution.
Variance is invariant with respect to changes in a location parameter.  That is, if a constant is added to all values of the variable, the variance is unchanged:
If all values are scaled by a constant, the variance is scaled by the square of that constant:

This implies that the variance of the mean can be written as (with a column vector of ones)
One reason for the use of the variance in preference to other measures of dispersion is that the variance of the sum (or the difference) of uncorrelated random variables is the sum of their variances:
This statement is called the Bienaymé formula[6] and was discovered in 1853.[7][8] It is often made with the stronger condition that the variables are independent, but being uncorrelated suffices. So if all the variables have the same variance σ2, then, since division by n is a linear transformation, this formula immediately implies that the variance of their mean is
That is, the variance of the mean decreases when n increases. This formula for the variance of the mean is used in the definition of the standard error of the sample mean, which is used in the central limit theorem.
To prove the initial statement, it suffices to show that
The general result then follows by induction.  Starting with the definition,
Using the linearity of the expectation operator and the assumption of independence (or uncorrelatedness) of X and Y, this further simplifies as follows:
In general, the variance of the sum of n variables is the sum of their covariances:
(Note: The second equality comes from the fact that Cov(Xi,Xi) = Var(Xi).)
Here, 



Cov
⁡
(
⋅
,
⋅
)


{\displaystyle \operatorname {Cov} (\cdot ,\cdot )}

 is the covariance, which is zero for independent random variables (if it exists). The formula states that the variance of a sum is equal to the sum of all elements in the covariance matrix of the components. The next expression states equivalently that the variance of the sum is the sum of the diagonal of covariance matrix plus two times the sum of its upper triangular elements (or its lower triangular elements); this emphasizes that the covariance matrix is symmetric. This formula is used in the theory of Cronbach's alpha in classical test theory.
So if the variables have equal variance σ2 and the average correlation of distinct variables is ρ, then the variance of their mean is
This implies that the variance of the mean increases with the average of the correlations. In other words, additional correlated observations are not as effective as additional independent observations at reducing the uncertainty of the mean. Moreover, if the variables have unit variance, for example if they are standardized, then this simplifies to
This formula is used in the Spearman–Brown prediction formula of classical test theory. This converges to ρ if n goes to infinity, provided that the average correlation remains constant or converges too. So for the variance of the mean of standardized variables with equal correlations or converging average correlation we have
Therefore, the variance of the mean of a large number of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation. This makes clear that the sample mean of correlated variables does not generally converge to the population mean, even though the law of large numbers states that the sample mean will converge for independent variables.
There are cases when a sample is taken without knowing, in advance, how many observations will be acceptable according to some criterion. In such cases, the sample size N is a random variable whose variation adds to the variation of X, such that,

The scaling property and the Bienaymé formula, along with the property of the covariance Cov(aX, bY) = ab Cov(X, Y)  jointly imply that
This implies that in a weighted sum of variables, the variable with the largest weight will have a disproportionally large weight in the variance of the total. For example, if X and Y are uncorrelated and the weight of X is two times the weight of Y, then the weight of the variance of X will be four times the weight of the variance of Y.
The expression above can be extended to a weighted sum of multiple variables:
If two variables X and Y are independent, the variance of their product is given by[10]
Equivalently, using the basic properties of expectation, it is given by
In general, if two variables are statistically dependent, then the variance of their product is given by:
The delta method uses second-order Taylor expansions to approximate the variance of a function of one or more random variables: see Taylor expansions for the moments of functions of random variables. For example, the approximate variance of a function of one variable is given by
provided that f is twice differentiable and that the mean and variance of X are finite.

Real-world observations such as the measurements of yesterday's rain throughout the day typically cannot be complete sets of all possible observations that could be made. As such, the variance calculated from the finite set will in general not match the variance that would have been calculated from the full population of possible observations.  This means that one estimates the mean and variance from a limited set of observations by using an estimator equation.  The estimator is a function of the sample of n observations drawn without observational bias from the whole population of potential observations. In this example that sample would be the set of actual measurements of yesterday's rainfall from available rain gauges within the geography of interest.
The simplest estimators for population mean and population variance are simply the mean and variance of the sample, the sample mean and (uncorrected) sample variance – these are consistent estimators (they converge to the correct value as the number of samples increases), but can be improved. Estimating the population variance by taking the sample's variance is close to optimal in general, but can be improved in two  ways. Most simply, the sample variance is computed as an average of squared deviations about the (sample) mean, by dividing by n. However, using values other than n improves the estimator in various ways. Four common values for the denominator are n, n − 1, n + 1, and n − 1.5: n is the simplest (population variance of the sample), n − 1 eliminates bias, n + 1 minimizes mean squared error for the normal distribution, and n − 1.5 mostly eliminates bias in unbiased estimation of standard deviation for the normal distribution.
Firstly, if the true population mean is unknown, then the sample variance (which uses the sample mean in place of the true mean) is a biased estimator: it underestimates the variance by a factor of (n − 1) / n; correcting by this factor (dividing by n − 1 instead of n) is called Bessel's correction. The resulting estimator is unbiased, and is called the (corrected) sample variance or unbiased sample variance. For example, when n = 1 the variance of a single observation about the sample mean (itself) is obviously zero regardless of the population variance. If the mean is determined in some other way than from the same samples used to estimate the variance then this bias does not arise and the variance can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the (independently known) mean.
Secondly, the sample variance does not generally minimize mean squared error between sample variance and population variance. Correcting for bias often makes this worse: one can always choose a scale factor that performs better than the corrected sample variance, though the optimal scale factor depends on the excess kurtosis of the population (see mean squared error: variance), and introduces bias. This always consists of scaling down the unbiased estimator (dividing by a number larger than n − 1), and is a simple example of a shrinkage estimator: one "shrinks" the unbiased estimator towards zero. For the normal distribution, dividing by n + 1 (instead of n − 1 or n) minimizes mean squared error. The resulting estimator is biased, however, and is known as the biased sample variation.
In general, the population variance of a finite population of size N with values xi is given by
where the population mean is
The population variance can also be computed using
This is true because
The population variance matches the variance of the generating probability distribution. In this sense, the concept of population can be extended to continuous random variables with infinite populations.
In many practical situations, the true variance of a population is not known a priori and must be computed somehow.  When dealing with extremely large populations, it is not possible to count every object in the population, so the computation must be performed on a sample of the population.[11] This is generally referred to as sample variance or empirical variance. Sample variance can also be applied to the estimation of the variance of a continuous distribution from a sample of that distribution.
We take a  sample with replacement of n values Y1, ..., Yn from the population, where n < N, and estimate the variance on the basis of this sample.[12] Directly taking the variance of the sample data gives the average of the squared deviations:
Here,

:
Either estimator may be simply referred to as the sample variance when the version can be determined by context. The same proof is also applicable for samples taken from a continuous probability distribution.
The use of the term n − 1 is called Bessel's correction, and it is also used in sample covariance and the sample standard deviation (the square root of variance). The square root is a concave function and thus introduces negative bias (by Jensen's inequality), which depends on the distribution, and thus the corrected sample standard deviation (using Bessel's correction) is biased. The unbiased estimation of standard deviation is a technically involved problem, though for the normal distribution using the term n − 1.5 yields an almost unbiased estimator.
The unbiased sample variance is a U-statistic for the function ƒ(y1, y2) = (y1 − y2)2/2, meaning that it is obtained by averaging a 2-sample statistic over 2-element subsets of the population.
Being a function of random variables, the sample variance is itself a random variable, and it is natural to study its distribution. In the case that Yi are independent observations from a normal distribution, Cochran's theorem shows that S2 follows a scaled chi-squared distribution (see also: asymptotic properties and an elementary proof):[13]
As a direct consequence, it follows that 
and[14]
If the Yi are independent and identically distributed, but not necessarily normally distributed, then[15]
where κ is the kurtosis of the distribution and μ4 is the fourth central moment.
If the conditions of the law of large numbers hold for the squared observations, S2 is a consistent estimator of σ2. One can see indeed that the variance of the estimator tends asymptotically to zero.  An asymptotically equivalent formula was given in Kenney and Keeping (1951:164), Rose and Smith (2002:264), and Weisstein (n.d.).[16][17][18]
Samuelson's inequality is a result that states bounds on the values that individual observations in a sample can take, given that the sample mean and (biased) variance have been calculated.[19] Values must lie within the limits

The F-test of equality of variances and the chi square tests are adequate when the sample is normally distributed. Non-normality makes testing for the equality of two or more variances more difficult. 
Several non parametric tests have been proposed: these include the Barton–David–Ansari–Freund–Siegel–Tukey test, the Capon test, Mood test, the Klotz test and the Sukhatme test. The Sukhatme test applies to two variances and requires that both medians be known and equal to zero. The Mood, Klotz, Capon and Barton–David–Ansari–Freund–Siegel–Tukey tests also apply to two variances. They allow the median to be unknown but do require that the two medians are equal.
The Lehmann test is a parametric test of two variances. Of this test there are several variants known. Other tests of the equality of variances include the Box test, the Box–Anderson test and the Moses test.
Resampling methods, which include the bootstrap and the jackknife, may be used to test the equality of variances.
The variance of a probability distribution is analogous to the  moment of inertia in classical mechanics of a corresponding mass distribution along a line, with respect to rotation about its center of mass.[citation needed]  It is because of this analogy that such things as the variance are called moments of probability distributions.[citation needed] The covariance matrix is related to the moment of inertia tensor for multivariate distributions. The moment of inertia of a cloud of n points with a covariance matrix of 



Σ


{\displaystyle \Sigma }

 is given by[citation needed]
This difference between moment of inertia in physics and in statistics is clear for points that are gathered along a line. Suppose many points are close to the x axis and distributed along it. The covariance matrix might look like
That is, there is the most variance in the x direction.  Physicists would consider this to have a low moment about the x axis so the moment-of-inertia tensor is

{\displaystyle {\text{Semivariance}}={1 \over {n}}\sum _{i:x_{i}<\mu }(x_{i}-\mu )^{2}}

It is also described as a specific measure in different fields of application. For skewed distributions, the semivariance can provide additional information that a variance does not.[22]
For inequalities associated with the semivariance, see Chebyshev's inequality § Semivariances.
If 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 is a scalar complex-valued random variable, with values in 




C

,


{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ,}

 then its variance is

,


{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \left[(x-\mu )(x-\mu )^{*}\right],}

 where 




x

∗




{\displaystyle x^{*}}

 is the complex conjugate of 



x
.


{\displaystyle x.}

  This variance is a real scalar.
If 



X


{\displaystyle X}

 is a vector-valued random variable, with values in 





R

,


{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n},}

 and thought of as a column vector, then a natural generalization of variance is

{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )(X-\mu )^{\operatorname {T} }\right],}

{\displaystyle \mu =\operatorname {E} (X)}

 and 




X

T




{\displaystyle X^{\operatorname {T} }}

 is the transpose of 



X

{\displaystyle X,}

 and so is a row vector.  The result is a positive semi-definite square matrix, commonly referred to as the variance-covariance matrix (or simply as the covariance matrix).
If 



X


{\displaystyle X}

C

{\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n},}

 then the covariance matrix is

{\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \left[(X-\mu )(X-\mu )^{\dagger }\right],}

{\displaystyle X^{\dagger }}

{\displaystyle X.}

[citation needed]  This matrix is also positive semi-definite and square.
Another generalization of variance for vector-valued random variables 



X


{\displaystyle X}

, which results in a scalar value rather than in a matrix, is the generalized variance 



det

C
)


{\displaystyle \det(C)}

, the determinant of the covariance matrix. The generalized variance can be shown to be related to the multidimensional scatter of points around their mean.[23]
A different generalization is obtained by considering the variance of the Euclidean distance between the random variable and its mean. This results in
