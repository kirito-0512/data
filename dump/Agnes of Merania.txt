1553,
Agnes of Merania,
Agnes of Merania (1175 – July 1201) was Queen of France by marriage to King Philip II. She is called Marie by some of the French chroniclers.[1]
Agnes Maria was the daughter of Berthold, Duke of Merania[2] and Agnes of Rochlitz.[3]
In June 1196, Agnes married Philip II of France, who had repudiated his second wife Ingeborg of Denmark in 1193.[4] Pope Innocent III espoused the cause of Ingeborg; but Philip did not submit until 1200, when, nine months after interdict had been added to excommunication, he consented to a separation from Agnes.[5]
Agnes died giving birth to their third child in July of the next year, at the castle of Poissy, and was buried in the Convent of St Corentin, near Nantes.[5]
Agnes and Philip had two children: 
Both were legitimized by the Pope in 1201.[6]
