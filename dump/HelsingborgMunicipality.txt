147,734 on January 1, 2019, and the metro has about 320,000 inhabitants.
Between 1912 and 1971 the name of the town was officially spelled Hälsingborg (rather like the region of Hälsingland but unlike neighbouring Danish Helsingør and the Finnish capital Helsingfors (Helsinki)). The spelling was changed back to the older version when the present municipality was created in 1971 through the amalgamation of the Town of Hälsingborg with four surrounding rural municipalities. Since the 1990s the municipality again styles itself Helsingborgs stad (Town of Helsingborg). This usage is only nominal and has no effect on the status of the municipality.
As of 2018, there were 16 urban areas the municipality.
