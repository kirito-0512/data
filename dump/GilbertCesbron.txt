Gilbert Cesbron (13 January 1913, Paris – 12 August 1979, Paris) was a French novelist. Born in Paris, Cesbron attended what is now known as Lycée Condorcet. In 1944 he published his first novel, Les innocents de Paris ("The Innocent of Paris"), in Switzerland. He first achieved wide public acclaim with the publication of Notre prison est un royaume ("Our Prison is a Kingdom") in 1948 and Il est minuit, docteur Schweitzer ("It is midnight, Doctor Schweitzer") in 1950.
In his works Cesbron tended to illustrate and describe relevant social topics such as juvenile delinquency in Chiens perdus sans collier ("Lost Dogs Without Collars"), violence in Entre chiens et loups ("Between Dogs and Wolves"), euthanasia in Il est plus tard que tu ne penses ("It is Later than You Think") and working priests in Les Saints vont en enfer ("Saints go to Hell").
In 1955 Cesbron's book Chiens perdus sans collier, the story of an orphan boy and a benevolent judge, was made into a movie [fr] starring Jean Gabin and Robert Dalban.
He died on 12 August 1979 at his home at 126 Boulevard Saint-Germain in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. He is buried in Bourré, Loir-et-Cher.  His widow, Dominique, died in 2003.[1]
