The Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro (Serbo-Croatian: Војска Србије и Црне Горе, Vojska Srbije i Crne Gore, ВСЦГ / VSCG) included ground forces with internal and border troops, naval forces, air and air defense forces, and civil defense. Preceding the VSCG was the Army of Yugoslavia (1992–2003; Serbo-Croatian: Војска Југославије, BJ / Vojska Jugoslavije, VJ)[1] from the remnants of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), the military of SFR Yugoslavia. The state, then named Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, participated in the Yugoslav Wars with limited direct intervention of its own armed forces. Following the end of the Wars and the constitutional reforms of 2003 by which the state was renamed "Serbia and Montenegro", the military accordingly changed its name. The military was heavily involved in combating Albanian separatists during the Kosovo War and Preševo Valley conflict, and also engaged NATO airplanes during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
Upon the dissolution of Serbia and Montenegro with the Montenegrin independence referendum (2006), a fraction of the joint military was given to Montenegro, with the bulk of the force remaining in Serbia. Montenegro inherited the navy as Serbia is landlocked.
The Armed Forces of Yugoslavia (VJ) was organized into the following:
The inventory included MiG-21 (fighter/recon/trainer), MiG-29 (fighter/trainer), Soko J-22 (ground/recon/trainer), Soko G-2 (fighter/bomber/trainer), Soko G-4 (fighter/bomber/target/trainer, Antonov An-2 (cargo), Antonov An-26 (cargo), Yakovlev Yak-40 (VIP), Mil Mi-8 (multirole), Mil Mi-14 (anti-submarine), Kamov Ka-25 (anti-submarine), Kamov Ka-28 (anti-submarine), Aérospatiale Gazelle (attack/utility/recon).
The Navy, officially called as the War Navy of the Army of Yugoslavia (Serbo-Croatian: Ратна морнарица Војске Југославије, Ratna mornarica Vojske Jugoslavije, RMVJ) from 1992 to 2003 and the Navy of Serbia and Montenegro (Serbo-Croatian: Ратна Морнарица Србије и Црне Горе, Ratna Mornarica Srbije i Crne Gore, lit. 'War Navy of Serbia and Montenegro') from 2003 to 2006, was based in Kotor and was largely made of vessels inherited from the pre-1992 Federal Yugoslav Navy (Serbo-Croatian: Југословенска ратна морнарица, Jugoslovenska ratna mornarica, lit. 'Yugoslav War Navy').[4][5] During NATO's Operation Allied Force in 1999, the Navy took control over civilian shipping around Kotor, despite NATO's blockade[6] and in several actions the navy's warships fired at NATO aircraft that were on their way to strike Yugoslav targets.[7] The Navy claimed to have shot down three UAVs over Boka Kotorska. The images of the remains of one of them were displayed online.[8]
