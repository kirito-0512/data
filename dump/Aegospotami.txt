Aegospotami (Ancient Greek: Αἰγὸς Ποταμοί, Aigos Potamoi) or Aegospotamos[1] (i.e. Goat Streams) is the ancient Greek name for a small river issuing into the Hellespont (Modern Turkish Çanakkale Boğazı), northeast of Sestos.[2]
At its mouth was the scene of the decisive battle in 405 BC in which Lysander destroyed the Athenian fleet, ending the Peloponnesian War.[3][4] The ancient Greek township of the same name, whose existence is attested by coins of the 5th and 4th centuries,[5] and the river itself were located in ancient Thrace in the Chersonese.[1]
According to ancient sources including Pliny the Elder and Aristotle, in 467 BC a large meteorite landed near Aegospotami. It was described as brown in colour and the size of a wagon load. A comet, tentatively identified as Halley's Comet, was reported at the time the meteorite landed. This is possibly the first European record of Halley's comet.[6][7]
Aegospotami is located on the Dardanelles, northeast of the modern Turkish town of Sütlüce, Gelibolu.[8]
