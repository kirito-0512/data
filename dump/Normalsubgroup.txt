Normalsubgroup,
In abstract algebra, a normal subgroup (also known as an invariant subgroup or self-conjugate subgroup)[1] is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by members of the group of which it is a part. In other words, a subgroup 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 of the group 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 is normal in 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 if and only if 



g
n

g

−
1


∈
N


{\displaystyle gng^{-1}\in N}

 for all 



g
∈
G


{\displaystyle g\in G}

 and 



n
∈
N
.


{\displaystyle n\in N.}

 The usual notation for this relation is 



N
◃
G
.


{\displaystyle N\triangleleft G.}


Normal subgroups are important because they (and only they) can be used to construct quotient groups of the given group.  Furthermore, the normal subgroups of 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 are precisely the kernels of group homomorphisms with domain 



G
,


{\displaystyle G,}

 which means that they can be used to internally classify those homomorphisms.
Évariste Galois was the first to realize the importance of the existence of normal subgroups.[2]
A subgroup 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 of a group 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 is called a normal subgroup of 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 if it is invariant under conjugation; that is, the conjugation of an element of 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 by an element of 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 is always in 



N
.


{\displaystyle N.}

[3]  The usual notation for this relation is 



N
◃
G
.


{\displaystyle N\triangleleft G.}


For any subgroup 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 of 



G
,


{\displaystyle G,}

 the following conditions are equivalent to 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 being a normal subgroup of 



G
.


{\displaystyle G.}

 Therefore, any one of them may be taken as the definition.
For any group 



G
,


{\displaystyle G,}

 the trivial subgroup 



{
e
}


{\displaystyle \{e\}}

 consisting of just the identity element of 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 is always a normal subgroup of 



G
.


{\displaystyle G.}

  Likewise, 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 itself is always a normal subgroup of 



G
.


{\displaystyle G.}

 (If these are the only normal subgroups, then 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 is said to be simple.)[6]  Other named normal subgroups of an arbitrary group include the center of the group (the set of elements that commute with all other elements) and the commutator subgroup 



[
G
,
G
]
.


{\displaystyle [G,G].}

[7][8]  More generally, since conjugation is an isomorphism, any characteristic subgroup is a normal subgroup.[9]
If 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 is an abelian group then every subgroup 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 of 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 is normal, because 



g
N
=
{
g
n

}

n
∈
N


=
{
n
g

}

n
∈
N


=
N
g
.


{\displaystyle gN=\{gn\}_{n\in N}=\{ng\}_{n\in N}=Ng.}

 More generally, for any group 



G


{\displaystyle G}

, every subgroup of the center 



Z
(
G
)


{\displaystyle Z(G)}

 of 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 is normal in 



G


{\displaystyle G}

. (In the special case that 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 is abelian, the center is all of 



G


{\displaystyle G}

, hence the fact that all subgroups of an abelian group are normal.)  A group that is not abelian but for which every subgroup is normal is called a Hamiltonian group.[10]
A concrete example of a normal subgroup is the subgroup 



N
=
{
(
1
)
,
(
123
)
,
(
132
)
}


{\displaystyle N=\{(1),(123),(132)\}}

 of the symmetric group 




S

3


,


{\displaystyle S_{3},}

 consisting of the identity and both three-cycles.  In particular, one can check that every coset of 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 is either equal to 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 itself or is equal to 



(
12
)
N
=
{
(
12
)
,
(
23
)
,
(
13
)
}
.


{\displaystyle (12)N=\{(12),(23),(13)\}.}

  On the other hand, the subgroup 



H
=
{
(
1
)
,
(
12
)
}


{\displaystyle H=\{(1),(12)\}}

 is not normal in 




S

3




{\displaystyle S_{3}}

 since 



(
123
)
H
=
{
(
123
)
,
(
13
)
}
≠
{
(
123
)
,
(
23
)
}
=
H
(
123
)
.


{\displaystyle (123)H=\{(123),(13)\}\neq \{(123),(23)\}=H(123).}

[11] This illustrates the general fact that any subgroup 



H
≤
G


{\displaystyle H\leq G}

 of index two is normal.
As an example of a normal subgroup within a matrix group, consider the general linear group 





G
L


n


(

R

)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )}

 of all invertible 



n
×
n


{\displaystyle n\times n}

 matrices with real entries under the operation of matrix multiplication and its subgroup 





S
L


n


(

R

)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )}

 of all 



n
×
n


{\displaystyle n\times n}

 matrices of determinant 1 (the special linear group).  To see why the subgroup 





S
L


n


(

R

)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )}

 is normal in 





G
L


n


(

R

)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )}

, consider any matrix 



X


{\displaystyle X}

 in 





S
L


n


(

R

)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )}

 and any invertible matrix 



A


{\displaystyle A}

.  Then using the two important identities 



det
(
A
B
)
=
det
(
A
)
det
(
B
)


{\displaystyle \det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B)}

 and 



det
(

A

−
1


)
=
det
(
A

)

−
1




{\displaystyle \det(A^{-1})=\det(A)^{-1}}

, one has that 



det
(
A
X

A

−
1


)
=
det
(
A
)
det
(
X
)
det
(
A

)

−
1


=
det
(
X
)
=
1


{\displaystyle \det(AXA^{-1})=\det(A)\det(X)\det(A)^{-1}=\det(X)=1}

, and so 



A
X

A

−
1


∈


S
L


n


(

R

)


{\displaystyle AXA^{-1}\in \mathrm {SL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )}

 as well.  This means  





S
L


n


(

R

)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {SL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )}

 is closed under conjugation in 





G
L


n


(

R

)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {GL} _{n}(\mathbf {R} )}

, so it is a normal subgroup.[a]
In the Rubik's Cube group, the subgroups consisting of operations which only affect the orientations of either the corner pieces or the edge pieces are normal.[12]
The translation group is a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group in any dimension.[13] This means: applying a rigid transformation, followed by a translation and then the inverse rigid transformation, has the same effect as a single translation. By contrast, the subgroup of all rotations about the origin is not a normal subgroup of the Euclidean group, as long as the dimension is at least 2: first translating, then rotating about the origin, and then translating back will typically not fix the origin and will therefore not have the same effect as a single rotation about the origin.
Given two normal subgroups, 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 and 



M
,


{\displaystyle M,}

 of 



G
,


{\displaystyle G,}

 their intersection 



N
∩
M


{\displaystyle N\cap M}

and their product 



N
M
=
{
n
m
:
n
∈
N


 and 


m
∈
M
}


{\displaystyle NM=\{nm:n\in N\;{\text{ and }}\;m\in M\}}

 are also normal subgroups of 



G
.


{\displaystyle G.}


The normal subgroups of 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 form a lattice under subset inclusion with least element, 



{
e
}
,


{\displaystyle \{e\},}

 and greatest element, 



G
.


{\displaystyle G.}

 The meet of two normal subgroups, 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 and 



M
,


{\displaystyle M,}

 in this lattice is their intersection and the join is their product.
The lattice is complete and modular.[20]
If 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 is a normal subgroup, we can define a multiplication on cosets as follows: 





(


a

1


N

)


(


a

2


N

)

:=

(


a

1



a

2



)

N
.


{\displaystyle \left(a_{1}N\right)\left(a_{2}N\right):=\left(a_{1}a_{2}\right)N.}


This relation defines a mapping 



G

/

N
×
G

/

N
→
G

/

N
.


{\displaystyle G/N\times G/N\to G/N.}

 To show that this mapping is well-defined, one needs to prove that the choice of representative elements 




a

1


,

a

2




{\displaystyle a_{1},a_{2}}

 does not affect the result. To this end, consider some other representative elements 




a

1

′

∈

a

1


N
,

a

2

′

∈

a

2


N
.


{\displaystyle a_{1}'\in a_{1}N,a_{2}'\in a_{2}N.}

 Then there are 




n

1


,

n

2


∈
N


{\displaystyle n_{1},n_{2}\in N}

 such that 




a

1

′

=

a

1



n

1


,

a

2

′

=

a

2



n

2


.


{\displaystyle a_{1}'=a_{1}n_{1},a_{2}'=a_{2}n_{2}.}

 It follows that 




a

1

′


a

2

′

N
=

a

1



n

1



a

2



n

2


N
=

a

1



a

2



n

1

′


n

2


N
=

a

1



a

2


N
,


{\displaystyle a_{1}'a_{2}'N=a_{1}n_{1}a_{2}n_{2}N=a_{1}a_{2}n_{1}'n_{2}N=a_{1}a_{2}N,}

where we also used the fact that 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 is a normal subgroup, and therefore there is 




n

1

′

∈
N


{\displaystyle n_{1}'\in N}

 such that 




n

1



a

2


=

a

2



n

1

′

.


{\displaystyle n_{1}a_{2}=a_{2}n_{1}'.}

 This proves that this product is a well-defined mapping between cosets.
With this operation, the set of cosets is itself a group, called the quotient group and denoted with 



G

/

N
.


{\displaystyle G/N.}

 There is a natural homomorphism, 



f
:
G
→
G

/

N
,


{\displaystyle f:G\to G/N,}

 given by 



f
(
a
)
=
a
N
.


{\displaystyle f(a)=aN.}

 This homomorphism maps 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 into the identity element of 



G

/

N
,


{\displaystyle G/N,}

 which is the coset 



e
N
=
N
,


{\displaystyle eN=N,}

[23] that is, 



ker
⁡
(
f
)
=
N
.


{\displaystyle \ker(f)=N.}


In general, a group homomorphism, 



f
:
G
→
H


{\displaystyle f:G\to H}

 sends subgroups of 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 to subgroups of 



H
.


{\displaystyle H.}

 Also, the preimage of any subgroup of 



H


{\displaystyle H}

 is a subgroup of 



G
.


{\displaystyle G.}

 We call the preimage of the trivial group 



{
e
}


{\displaystyle \{e\}}

 in 



H


{\displaystyle H}

 the kernel of the homomorphism and denote it by 



ker
⁡
f
.


{\displaystyle \ker f.}

 As it turns out, the kernel is always normal and the image of 



G
,
f
(
G
)
,


{\displaystyle G,f(G),}

 is always isomorphic to 



G

/

ker
⁡
f


{\displaystyle G/\ker f}

 (the first isomorphism theorem).[24] In fact, this correspondence is a bijection between the set of all quotient groups of 



G
,
G

/

N
,


{\displaystyle G,G/N,}

 and the set of all homomorphic images of 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 (up to isomorphism).[25] It is also easy to see that the kernel of the quotient map, 



f
:
G
→
G

/

N
,


{\displaystyle f:G\to G/N,}

 is 



N


{\displaystyle N}

 itself, so the normal subgroups are precisely the kernels of homomorphisms with domain 



G
.


{\displaystyle G.}
