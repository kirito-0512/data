Necrosis,
Necrosis (from Ancient Greek  νέκρωσις (nékrōsis) 'death') is a form of cell injury which results in the premature death of cells in living tissue by autolysis.[1] Necrosis is caused by factors external to the cell or tissue, such as infection, or trauma which result in the unregulated digestion of cell components. In contrast, apoptosis is a naturally occurring programmed and targeted cause of cellular death. While apoptosis often provides beneficial effects to the organism, necrosis is almost always detrimental and can be fatal.[2]
Cellular death due to necrosis does not follow the apoptotic signal transduction pathway, but rather various receptors are activated and result in the loss of cell membrane integrity[3] and an uncontrolled release of products of cell death into the extracellular space.[1] This initiates in the surrounding tissue an inflammatory response, which attracts leukocytes and nearby phagocytes which eliminate the dead cells by phagocytosis. However, microbial damaging substances released by leukocytes would create collateral damage to surrounding tissues.[4] This excess collateral damage inhibits the healing process. Thus, untreated necrosis results in a build-up of decomposing dead tissue and cell debris at or near the site of the cell death. A classic example is gangrene. For this reason, it is often necessary to remove necrotic tissue surgically, a procedure known as debridement.[citation needed]
Structural signs that indicate irreversible cell injury and the progression of necrosis include dense clumping and progressive disruption of genetic material, and disruption to membranes of cells and organelles.[5]
There are six distinctive morphological patterns of necrosis:[6]
Necrosis may occur due to external or internal factors.
External factors may involve mechanical trauma (physical damage to the body which causes cellular breakdown), damage to blood vessels (which may disrupt blood supply to associated tissue), and ischemia.[13] Thermal effects (extremely high or low temperature) can result in necrosis due to the disruption of cells.[citation needed]
In frostbite, crystals form, increasing the pressure of remaining tissue and fluid causing the cells to burst.[citation needed] Under extreme conditions tissues and cells die through an unregulated process of destruction of membranes and cytosol.[14]
Internal factors causing necrosis include: trophoneurotic disorders (diseases that occur due to defective nerve action in a part of an organ which results in failure of nutrition); injury and paralysis of nerve cells. Pancreatic enzymes (lipases) are the major cause of fat necrosis.[13]
Necrosis can be activated by components of the immune system, such as the complement system; bacterial toxins; activated natural killer cells; and peritoneal macrophages.[1] Pathogen-induced necrosis programs in cells with immunological barriers (intestinal mucosa) may alleviate invasion of pathogens through surfaces affected by inflammation.[1] Toxins and pathogens may cause necrosis; toxins such as snake venoms may inhibit enzymes and cause cell death.[13] Necrotic wounds have also resulted from the stings of Vespa mandarinia.[15]
Pathological conditions are characterized by inadequate secretion of cytokines. Nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also accompanied by intense necrotic death of cells.[13] A classic example of a necrotic condition is ischemia which leads to a drastic depletion of oxygen, glucose, and other trophic factors and induces massive necrotic death of endothelial cells and non-proliferating cells of surrounding tissues (neurons, cardiomyocytes, renal cells, etc.).[1] Recent cytological data indicates that necrotic death occurs not only during pathological events but it is also a component of some physiological process.[13]
Activation-induced death of primary T lymphocytes and other important constituents of the immune response are caspase-independent and necrotic by morphology; hence, current researchers have demonstrated that necrotic cell death can occur not only during pathological processes, but also during normal processes such as tissue renewal, embryogenesis, and immune response.[13]
Until recently, necrosis was thought to be an unregulated process.[16] However, there are two broad pathways in which necrosis may occur in an organism.[16]
The first of these two pathways initially involves oncosis, where swelling of the cells occurs.[16] Affected cells then proceed to blebbing, and this is followed by pyknosis, in which nuclear shrinkage transpires.[16] In the final step of this pathway cell nuclei are dissolved into the cytoplasm, which is referred to as karyolysis.[16]
The second pathway is a secondary form of necrosis that is shown to occur after apoptosis and budding.[16] In these cellular changes of necrosis, the nucleus breaks into fragments (known as karyorrhexis).[16]
The nucleus changes in necrosis and characteristics of this change are determined by the manner in which its DNA breaks down:
Other typical cellular changes in necrosis include:
On a larger histologic scale, pseudopalisades (false palisades) are hypercellular zones that typically surround necrotic tissue. Pseudopalisading necrosis indicates an aggressive tumor.[18]

There are many causes of necrosis, and as such treatment is based upon how the necrosis came about. Treatment of necrosis typically involves two distinct processes: Usually, the underlying cause of the necrosis must be treated before the dead tissue itself can be dealt with.[citation needed]
Even after the initial cause of the necrosis has been halted, the necrotic tissue will remain in the body. The body's immune response to apoptosis, which involves the automatic breaking down and recycling of cellular material, is not triggered by necrotic cell death due to the apoptotic pathway being disabled.[24]
If calcium is deficient, pectin cannot be synthesized, and therefore the cell walls cannot be bonded and thus an impediment of the meristems. This will lead to necrosis of stem and root tips and leaf edges.[25] For example, necrosis of tissue can occur in Arabidopsis thaliana due to plant pathogens.[citation needed]
Cacti such as the Saguaro and Cardon in the Sonoran Desert experience necrotic patch formation regularly; a species of Dipterans called Drosophila mettleri has developed a p450 detoxification system to enable it to use the exudates released in these patches to both nest and feed larvae.[citation needed]
