Veloutésauce,
A velouté sauce (French pronunciation: ​[vəluˈte]) is a savory sauce that is made from a roux and a light stock. It is one of the "mother sauces" of French cuisine listed by chef Auguste Escoffier in the early twentieth century, along with  espagnole, tomato, béchamel, and mayonnaise or hollandaise. Velouté is  French for 'velvety'.
In preparing a velouté sauce, a light stock (one in which the bones of the base used have not been roasted previously), such as veal, chicken, or fish stock, is thickened with a blond roux. The sauce produced is commonly referred to by the type of stock used (e.g. chicken velouté, fish velouté, seafood velouté).[1]
Sauce velouté often is served on poultry or seafood dishes and is also used as the base for other sauces.
