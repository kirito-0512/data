Borelmeasure,
In mathematics, specifically in measure theory, a Borel measure on  a topological space is a measure that is defined on all open sets (and thus on all Borel sets).[1] Some authors require additional restrictions on the measure, as described below.
Let 
X
{\displaystyle X}
 be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let 
B
(
X
)
{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {B}}(X)}
 be the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open sets of 
X
{\displaystyle X}
; this is known as the σ-algebra of Borel sets.  A Borel measure is any measure 
μ
{\displaystyle \mu }
 defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets.[2] A few authors require in addition that 
μ
{\displaystyle \mu }
 is locally finite, meaning that 
μ
(
C
)
<
∞
{\displaystyle \mu (C)<\infty }
 for every compact set 
C
{\displaystyle C}
.  If a Borel measure 
μ
{\displaystyle \mu }
 is both inner regular and outer regular, it is called a regular Borel measure. If 
μ
{\displaystyle \mu }
 is both inner regular, outer regular, and locally finite, it is called a Radon measure.
The real line 
R
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
 with its usual topology is a locally compact Hausdorff space; hence we can define a Borel measure on it. In this case, 
B
(
R
)
{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {B}}(\mathbb {R} )}
 is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open intervals of 
R
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
. While there are many Borel measures μ, the choice of Borel measure that assigns 
μ
(
(
a
,
b
]
)
=
b
−
a
{\displaystyle \mu ((a,b])=b-a}
 for every half-open interval 
(
a
,
b
]
{\displaystyle (a,b]}
 is sometimes called "the" Borel measure on 
R
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
. This measure turns out to be the restriction to the Borel σ-algebra of the Lebesgue measure 
λ
{\displaystyle \lambda }
, which is a complete measure and is defined on the Lebesgue σ-algebra. The Lebesgue σ-algebra is actually the completion of the Borel σ-algebra, which means that it is the smallest σ-algebra that contains all the Borel sets and can be equipped with a complete measure. Also, the Borel measure and the Lebesgue measure coincide on the Borel sets (i.e., 
λ
(
E
)
=
μ
(
E
)
{\displaystyle \lambda (E)=\mu (E)}
 for every Borel measurable set, where 
μ
{\displaystyle \mu }
 is the Borel measure described above).
If X and Y are second-countable, Hausdorff topological spaces, then the set of Borel subsets 
B
(
X
×
Y
)
{\displaystyle B(X\times Y)}
 of their product coincides with the product of the sets 
B
(
X
)
×
B
(
Y
)
{\displaystyle B(X)\times B(Y)}
 of Borel subsets of X and Y.[3] That is, the Borel functor
from the category of second-countable Hausdorff spaces to the category of measurable spaces preserves finite products.
The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is the ordinary Lebesgue integral with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of bounded variation on the real line.  The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a regular Borel measure, and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.[4]
One can define the Laplace transform of a finite Borel measure μ on the real line by the Lebesgue integral[5]
An important special case is where μ is a probability measure or, even more specifically, the Dirac delta function. In operational calculus, the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a distribution function f.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes
where the lower limit of 0− is shorthand notation for
This limit emphasizes that any point mass located at 0 is entirely captured by the Laplace transform.  Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the Laplace–Stieltjes transform.
Given a Borel measure μ on a metric space X such that μ(X) > 0 and μ(B(x, r)) ≤ rs holds for some constant s > 0 and for every ball B(x, r) in X, then the Hausdorff dimension dimHaus(X) ≥ s. A partial converse is provided by the Frostman lemma:[6]
Lemma: Let A be a Borel subset of Rn, and let s > 0. Then the following are equivalent:
The Cramér–Wold theorem in measure theory states that a Borel probability measure on 
R
k
{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{k}}
 is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections.[7] It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results. The theorem is named after Harald Cramér and Herman Ole Andreas Wold.
