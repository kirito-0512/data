The Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK (/ˈswiːˌbɒk/ SWEE-bok[1])) is an international standard ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005[2] specifying a guide to the generally accepted software engineering body of knowledge.
The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Guide) has been created through cooperation among several professional bodies and members of industry and is published by the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE).[3] The standard can be accessed freely from the IEEE Computer Society.[4] In late 2013, SWEBOK V3 was approved for publication and released.[5] In 2016, the IEEE Computer Society kicked off the SWEBoK Evolution effort to develop future iterations of the body of knowledge.[6]
The published version of SWEBOK V3 has the following 15 knowledge areas (KAs) within the field of software engineering:
It also recognized, but did not define, these related disciplines:
The 2004 edition of the SWEBOK guide defined ten knowledge areas (KAs) within the field of software engineering:
The SWEBOK also defines disciplines related to software engineering:
A similar effort to define a body of knowledge for software engineering is the "Computing Curriculum Software Engineering (CCSE)," officially named Software Engineering 2004 (SE2004). The curriculum largely overlaps with the 2004 SWEBOK V2 because the SWEBOK has been used as one of its sources; however, it is more directed towards academia. Whereas the SWEBOK Guide defines the software engineering knowledge that practitioners should have after four years of practice, SE2004 defines the knowledge that an undergraduate software engineering student should possess upon graduation (including knowledge of mathematics, general engineering principles, and other related areas). SWEBOK V3 aims to address these intersections.
