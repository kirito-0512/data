Borsuk–Ulamtheorem,
In mathematics, the Borsuk–Ulam theorem states that every continuous function from an n-sphere into Euclidean n-space maps some pair of antipodal points to the same point. Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center.
Formally: if 
f
:
S
n
→
R
n
{\displaystyle f:S^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
 is continuous then there exists an 
x
∈
S
n
{\displaystyle x\in S^{n}}
 such that:  
f
(
−
x
)
=
f
(
x
)
{\displaystyle f(-x)=f(x)}
.
The case 
n
=
1
{\displaystyle n=1}
 can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the Earth's equator with the same temperature. The same is true for any circle. This assumes the temperature varies continuously in space.
The case 
n
=
2
{\displaystyle n=2}
 is often illustrated by saying that at any moment, there is always a pair of antipodal points on the Earth's surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures, assuming that both parameters vary continuously in space.
The Borsuk–Ulam theorem has several equivalent statements in terms of odd functions. Recall that 
S
n
{\displaystyle S^{n}}
 is the n-sphere and 
B
n
{\displaystyle B^{n}}
 is the n-ball:
According to Matoušek (2003, p. 25), the first historical mention of the statement of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem appears in Lyusternik & Shnirel'man (1930).  The first proof was given by Karol Borsuk (1933), where the formulation of the problem was attributed to Stanislaw Ulam.  Since then, many alternative proofs have been found by various authors, as collected by Steinlein (1985).
The following statements are equivalent to the Borsuk–Ulam theorem.[1]
A function 
g
{\displaystyle g}
 is called odd (aka antipodal or antipode-preserving) if for every 
x
{\displaystyle x}
: 
g
(
−
x
)
=
−
g
(
x
)
{\displaystyle g(-x)=-g(x)}
.
The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following statement: A continuous odd function from an n-sphere into Euclidean n-space has a zero. PROOF: 
Define a retraction as a function 
h
:
S
n
→
S
n
−
1
.
{\displaystyle h:S^{n}\to S^{n-1}.}
 The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following claim: there is no continuous odd retraction.
Proof: If the theorem is correct, then every continuous odd function from 
S
n
{\displaystyle S^{n}}
 must include 0 in its range. However,  
0
∉
S
n
−
1
{\displaystyle 0\notin S^{n-1}}
 so there cannot be a continuous odd function whose range is 
S
n
−
1
{\displaystyle S^{n-1}}
.
Conversely, if it is incorrect, then there is a continuous odd function 
g
:
S
n
→
R
n
{\displaystyle g:S^{n}\to {\mathbb {R}}^{n}}
 with no zeroes. Then we can construct another odd function 
h
:
S
n
→
S
n
−
1
{\displaystyle h:S^{n}\to S^{n-1}}
 by:
since 
g
{\displaystyle g}
 has no zeroes, 
h
{\displaystyle h}
 is well-defined and continuous. Thus we have a continuous odd retraction.
The 1-dimensional case can easily be proved using the intermediate value theorem (IVT).
Let 
g
{\displaystyle g}
 be the odd real-valued continuous function on a circle defined by 
g
(
x
)
=
f
(
x
)
−
f
(
−
x
)
{\displaystyle g(x)=f(x)-f(-x)}
. Pick an arbitrary 
x
{\displaystyle x}
. If 
g
(
x
)
=
0
{\displaystyle g(x)=0}
 then we are done. Otherwise, without loss of generality, 
g
(
x
)
>
0.
{\displaystyle g(x)>0.}
 But 
g
(
−
x
)
<
0.
{\displaystyle g(-x)<0.}
 Hence, by the IVT, there is a point 
y
{\displaystyle y}
 between 
x
{\displaystyle x}
 and 
−
x
{\displaystyle -x}
 at which 
g
(
y
)
=
0
{\displaystyle g(y)=0}
.
Assume that 
h
:
S
n
→
S
n
−
1
{\displaystyle h:S^{n}\to S^{n-1}}
 is an odd continuous function with 
n
>
2
{\displaystyle n>2}
 (the case 
n
=
1
{\displaystyle n=1}
 is treated above, the case 
n
=
2
{\displaystyle n=2}
 can be handled using basic covering theory). By passing to orbits under the antipodal action, we then get an induced continuous function 
h
′
:
R
P
n
→
R
P
n
−
1
{\displaystyle h':\mathbb {RP} ^{n}\to \mathbb {RP} ^{n-1}}
 between real projective spaces, which induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. By the Hurewicz theorem, the induced ring homomorphism on cohomology with 
F
2
{\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{2}}
 coefficients [where 
F
2
{\displaystyle \mathbb {F} _{2}}
 denotes the field with two elements], 
sends 
b
{\displaystyle b}
 to 
a
{\displaystyle a}
. But then we get that 
b
n
=
0
{\displaystyle b^{n}=0}
 is sent to 
a
n
≠
0
{\displaystyle a^{n}\neq 0}
, a contradiction.[2]
One can also show the stronger statement that any odd map 
S
n
−
1
→
S
n
−
1
{\displaystyle S^{n-1}\to S^{n-1}}
 has odd degree and then deduce the theorem from this result.
The Borsuk–Ulam theorem can be proved from Tucker's lemma.[1][3][4]
Let 
g
:
S
n
→
R
n
{\displaystyle g:S^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
 be a continuous odd function. Because g is continuous on a compact domain, it is uniformly continuous. Therefore, for every 
ϵ
>
0
{\displaystyle \epsilon >0}
, there is a 
δ
>
0
{\displaystyle \delta >0}
 such that, for every two points of 
S
n
{\displaystyle S_{n}}
 which are within 
δ
{\displaystyle \delta }
 of each other, their images under g are within 
ϵ
{\displaystyle \epsilon }
 of each other.
Define a triangulation of 
S
n
{\displaystyle S_{n}}
 with edges of length at most 
δ
{\displaystyle \delta }
. Label each vertex 
v
{\displaystyle v}
 of the triangulation with a label 
l
(
v
)
∈
±
1
,
±
2
,
…
,
±
n
{\displaystyle l(v)\in {\pm 1,\pm 2,\ldots ,\pm n}}
 in the following way:
Because g is odd, the labeling is also odd: 
l
(
−
v
)
=
−
l
(
v
)
{\displaystyle l(-v)=-l(v)}
. Hence, by Tucker's lemma, there are two adjacent vertices 
u
,
v
{\displaystyle u,v}
 with opposite labels. Assume w.l.o.g. that the labels are 
l
(
u
)
=
1
,
l
(
v
)
=
−
1
{\displaystyle l(u)=1,l(v)=-1}
. By the definition of l, this means that in both 
g
(
u
)
{\displaystyle g(u)}
 and 
g
(
v
)
{\displaystyle g(v)}
, coordinate #1 is the largest coordinate: in 
g
(
u
)
{\displaystyle g(u)}
 this coordinate is positive while in 
g
(
v
)
{\displaystyle g(v)}
 it is negative. By the construction of the triangulation, the distance between 
g
(
u
)
{\displaystyle g(u)}
 and 
g
(
v
)
{\displaystyle g(v)}
 is at most 
ϵ
{\displaystyle \epsilon }
, so in particular 
|
g
(
u
)
1
−
g
(
v
)
1
|
=
|
g
(
u
)
1
|
+
|
g
(
v
)
1
|
≤
ϵ
{\displaystyle |g(u)_{1}-g(v)_{1}|=|g(u)_{1}|+|g(v)_{1}|\leq \epsilon }
 (since 
g
(
u
)
1
{\displaystyle g(u)_{1}}
 and 
g
(
v
)
1
{\displaystyle g(v)_{1}}
 have opposite signs) and so 
|
g
(
u
)
1
|
≤
ϵ
{\displaystyle |g(u)_{1}|\leq \epsilon }
. But since the largest coordinate of 
g
(
u
)
{\displaystyle g(u)}
 is coordinate #1, this means that  
|
g
(
u
)
k
|
≤
ϵ
{\displaystyle |g(u)_{k}|\leq \epsilon }
 for each  
1
≤
k
≤
n
{\displaystyle 1\leq k\leq n}
. So 
|
g
(
u
)
|
≤
c
n
ϵ
{\displaystyle |g(u)|\leq c_{n}\epsilon }
, where 
c
n
{\displaystyle c_{n}}
 is some constant depending on 
n
{\displaystyle n}
 and the norm 
|
⋅
|
{\displaystyle |\cdot |}
 which you have chosen.
The above is true for every 
ϵ
>
0
{\displaystyle \epsilon >0}
; since  
S
n
{\displaystyle S_{n}}
 is compact there must hence be a point u in which 
|
g
(
u
)
|
=
0
{\displaystyle |g(u)|=0}
.
Above we showed how to prove the Borsuk–Ulam theorem from Tucker's lemma. The converse is also true: it is possible to prove Tucker's lemma from the Borsuk–Ulam theorem. Therefore, these two theorems are equivalent.
There are several fixed-point theorems which come in three equivalent variants: an algebraic topology variant, a combinatorial variant and a set-covering variant. Each variant can be proved separately using totally different arguments, but each variant can also be reduced to the other variants in its row. Additionally, each result in 
the top row can be deduced from the one below it in the same column.[5]
