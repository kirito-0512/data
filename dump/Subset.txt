Subset,
In mathematics, set A is a subset of a set B if all elements of A are also elements of B; B is then a superset of A. It is possible for A and B to be equal; if they are unequal, then A is a proper subset of B. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion (or sometimes containment). A is a subset of B may also be expressed as B includes (or contains) A or A is included (or contained) in B. A k-subset is a subset with k elements.
The subset relation defines a partial order on sets. In fact, the subsets of a given set form a Boolean algebra under the subset relation, in which the join and meet are given by intersection and union, and the subset relation itself is the Boolean inclusion relation.
If A and B are sets and every element of A is also an element of B, then:

If A is a subset of B, but A is not equal to B (i.e. there exists at least one element of B which is not an element of A), then: 
The empty set, written 



{
}


{\displaystyle \{\}}

 or 



∅
,


{\displaystyle \varnothing ,}

 is a subset of any set X and a proper subset of any set except itself, the inclusion relation 



⊆


{\displaystyle \subseteq }

 is a partial order on the set 





P


(
S
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(S)}

 (the power set of S—the set of all subsets of S[1]) defined by 



A
≤
B

⟺

A
⊆
B


{\displaystyle A\leq B\iff A\subseteq B}

. We may also partially order 





P


(
S
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(S)}

 by reverse set inclusion by defining 



A
≤
B

 if and only if 

B
⊆
A
.


{\displaystyle A\leq B{\text{ if and only if }}B\subseteq A.}


When quantified, 



A
⊆
B


{\displaystyle A\subseteq B}

 is represented as 



∀
x

(

x
∈
A

⟹

x
∈
B

)

.


{\displaystyle \forall x\left(x\in A\implies x\in B\right).}

[2]

We can prove the statement 



A
⊆
B


{\displaystyle A\subseteq B}

 by applying a proof technique known as the element argument[3]:Let sets A and B be given. To prove that 



A
⊆
B
,


{\displaystyle A\subseteq B,}


The validity of this technique can be seen as a consequence of Universal generalization: the technique shows 



c
∈
A

⟹

c
∈
B


{\displaystyle c\in A\implies c\in B}

 for an arbitrarily chosen element c. Universal generalisation then implies 



∀
x

(

x
∈
A

⟹

x
∈
B

)

,


{\displaystyle \forall x\left(x\in A\implies x\in B\right),}

 which is equivalent to 



A
⊆
B
,


{\displaystyle A\subseteq B,}

 as stated above.
The set of all subsets of 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is called its powerset, and is denoted by 





P


(
A
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(A)}

. The set of all 



k


{\displaystyle k}

-subsets of 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is denoted by 







(


A
k


)






{\displaystyle {\tbinom {A}{k}}}

, in analogue with the notation for binomial coefficients, which count the number of 



k


{\displaystyle k}

-subsets of an 



n


{\displaystyle n}

-element set. In set theory, the notation 



[
A

]

k




{\displaystyle [A]^{k}}

 is also common, especially when 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 is a transfinite cardinal number.
Some authors use the symbols 



⊂


{\displaystyle \subset }

 and 



⊃


{\displaystyle \supset }

 to indicate subset and superset respectively; that is, with the same meaning as and instead of the symbols 



⊆


{\displaystyle \subseteq }

 and 



⊇
.


{\displaystyle \supseteq .}

[4] For example, for these authors, it is true of every set A that 



A
⊂
A
.


{\displaystyle A\subset A.}


Other authors prefer to use the symbols 



⊂


{\displaystyle \subset }

 and 



⊃


{\displaystyle \supset }

 to indicate proper (also called strict) subset and proper superset respectively; that is, with the same meaning as and instead of the symbols 



⊊


{\displaystyle \subsetneq }

 and 



⊋
.


{\displaystyle \supsetneq .}

[5] This usage makes 



⊆


{\displaystyle \subseteq }

 and 



⊂


{\displaystyle \subset }

 analogous to the inequality symbols 



≤


{\displaystyle \leq }

 and 



<
.


{\displaystyle <.}

 For example, if 



x
≤
y
,


{\displaystyle x\leq y,}

 then x may or may not equal y, but if 



x
<
y
,


{\displaystyle x<y,}

 then x definitely does not equal y, and is less than y. Similarly, using the convention that 



⊂


{\displaystyle \subset }

 is proper subset, if 



A
⊆
B
,


{\displaystyle A\subseteq B,}

 then A may or may not equal B, but if 



A
⊂
B
,


{\displaystyle A\subset B,}

 then A definitely does not equal B.
Another example in an Euler diagram:
A is a proper subset of B.
C is a subset but not a proper subset of B.
Inclusion is the canonical partial order, in the sense that every partially ordered set 



(
X
,
⪯
)


{\displaystyle (X,\preceq )}

 is isomorphic to some collection of sets ordered by inclusion. The ordinal numbers are a simple example: if each ordinal n is identified with the set 



[
n
]


{\displaystyle [n]}

 of all ordinals less than or equal to n, then 



a
≤
b


{\displaystyle a\leq b}

 if and only if 



[
a
]
⊆
[
b
]
.


{\displaystyle [a]\subseteq [b].}


For the power set 





P


⁡
(
S
)


{\displaystyle \operatorname {\mathcal {P}} (S)}

 of a set S, the inclusion partial order is—up to an order isomorphism—the Cartesian product of 



k
=

|

S

|



{\displaystyle k=|S|}

 (the cardinality of S) copies of the partial order on 



{
0
,
1
}


{\displaystyle \{0,1\}}

 for which 



0
<
1.


{\displaystyle 0<1.}

 This can be illustrated by enumerating 



S
=

{


s

1


,

s

2


,
…
,

s

k



}

,


{\displaystyle S=\left\{s_{1},s_{2},\ldots ,s_{k}\right\},}

, and associating with each subset 



T
⊆
S


{\displaystyle T\subseteq S}

 (i.e., each element of 




2

S




{\displaystyle 2^{S}}

) the k-tuple from 



{
0
,
1

}

k


,


{\displaystyle \{0,1\}^{k},}

 of which the ith coordinate is 1 if and only if 




s

i




{\displaystyle s_{i}}

 is a member of T.
