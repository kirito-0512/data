Radondifluoride,
Radon difluoride (RnF2) is a compound of radon, a radioactive noble gas.  Radon reacts readily with fluorine to form a solid compound, but this decomposes on attempted vaporization and its exact composition is uncertain.[1][2]  Calculations suggest that it may be ionic,[3] unlike all other known binary noble gas compounds. The usefulness of radon compounds is limited because of the radioactivity of radon.  The longest-lived isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.82 days, which decays by α-emission to yield polonium-218.[4]
When radon is heated to 400 °C with fluorine, radon difluoride is formed.[1]
Radon difluoride can be reduced to radon and hydrogen fluoride when heated with hydrogen gas at 500 °C.[1]
