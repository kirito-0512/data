Alexandria,Romania,
Alexandria (Romanian pronunciation: [alekˈsandri.a] (listen)) is the capital city of the Teleorman County, Muntenia, Romania. It is located south-west of Bucharest, towards the Bulgarian border, and has over 45,000 inhabitants. The 44th parallel north passes just north of the city.
Alexandria is situated in the middle of the Wallachian Plain, on the banks of the Vedea River. It is located in the central part of Teleorman County, at a distance of 62 km (39 mi) from Giurgiu and 86 km (53 mi) from Bucharest. 
The city is traversed by the national road DN6, which links Bucharest to the Banat region in western Romania; the road is part of European route E70. The Alexandria train station serves the CFR Line 909, with service towards Roșiorii de Vede (to the northwest) and Zimnicea (to the south, on the Danube).
Alexandria was named after its founder, Alexandru D. Ghica, Prince of Wallachia from April 1834 to 7 October 1842. Its population in 1900 was 1,675. Grain, which was Alexandria's main trade at the time, was dispatched both by rail to the Danubian port of Zimnicea and by river to Giurgiu.[3]
In 1989, the city had over 63,000 inhabitants and more than six large factories. A 2020 estimate puts the population at 49,878.[4]
There are three high schools in Alexandria: the Alexandru D. Ghica National College, the Alexandru Ioan Cuza Theoretical High School, and the Constantin Noica Theoretical High School. 
In 1897, the Ștefan cel Mare School moved from its former location to 310 Libertății Street; a local entrepreneur, M. Frangulea, obtained the plot and hired renowned architect Alexandru Săvulescu to build the new boys' primary school for the city.[5]
The Diocese of Alexandria and Teleorman is a diocese of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Its see is Saint Alexander Cathedral [ro] in Alexandria and its ecclesiastical territory covers Teleorman County.
