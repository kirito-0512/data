Fieldstrength,
In physics, field strength is the magnitude of a vector-valued field (e.g., in volts per meter, V/m, for an electric field E).[1] 
For example, an electromagnetic field has both electric field strength and magnetic field strength.
As an application, in radio frequency telecommunications, the signal strength excites a receiving antenna and thereby induces a voltage at a specific frequency and polarization in order to provide an input signal to a radio receiver. Field strength meters are used for such applications as cellular, broadcasting, wi-fi and a wide variety of other radio-related applications.[2]
