Modes of transport in Gabon include rail, road, water, and air. The one rail link, the Trans-Gabon Railway, connects the port of Owendo with the inland town of Franceville. Most but not all of the country is connected to the road network, much of which is unpaved, and which centres on seven "national routes" identified as N1 to N7. The largest seaports are Port-Gentil and the newer Owendo, and 1,600 km of inland waterways are navigable. There are three international airports, eight other paved airports, and over 40 with unpaved runways. Nearly 300 km of pipelines carry petroleum products, mainly crude oil.
Until the 1970s Gabon had no permanent railroads, though temporary Decauville rail tracks were in use in the logging industry as early as 1913 (Gray and Ngolet, 1999, pp.102).[1]
In 2003, the railway began the process of installing a satellite based telecommunications system.[2] As of 2004, Gabon State Railways totalled 814 km of standard-gauge track.

Roads in Gabon link most areas of the country, and many of the main roads are of a reasonable standard.  However, remoter areas along the coast and in the east are often not connected to the road network.  Major roads are denoted national routes and numbered, with a prefix "N" (sometimes "RN"):
As of 2002, there was one merchant marine vessel, with a gross tonnage of 2,419/3,205 tonnes deadweight (DWT).
Gabon has 1,600 km of perennially navigable waterways, including 310 km on the Ogooué River.
