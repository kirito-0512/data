Lightbulbjoke,
A lightbulb joke is a joke cycle that asks how many people of a certain group are needed to change, replace, or screw in a light bulb. Generally, the punch line answer highlights a stereotype of the target group. There are numerous versions of the lightbulb joke satirizing a wide range of cultures, beliefs, and occupations.[1][2]
Early versions of the joke, popular in the late 1960s[3][4] and the 1970s, were used to insult the intelligence of people, especially Poles ("Polish jokes").[5][6] For instance:
Q. How many Polacks does it take to change a light bulb?
A. Three—one to hold the light bulb and two to turn the ladder.
Although lightbulb jokes tend to be derogatory in tone (e.g., "How many drunkards..." / "Four: one to hold the light bulb and three to drink until the room spins"), the people targeted by them may take pride in the stereotypes expressed and are often themselves the jokes' originators,[7] as in "How many Germans does it take to change a lightbulb? One, we're very efficient but not funny." where the joke itself becomes a statement of ethnic pride. Lightbulb jokes applied to subgroups can be used to ease tensions between them.[8]
Some versions of the joke are puns on the words "change"[9] or "screw",[10] or "light":
'Q. How many psychiatrists does it take to change a light bulb?
A. None—the light bulb will change when it's ready.[11][12]
Q. How many flies does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
A. Two, but don't ask me how they got in there.[13]
Q. How many hands does it take to change a lightbulb?
A. Many.
Lightbulb jokes may be responses to current events, particularly those related to energy.[14]
For example, the lightbulb may not need to be changed at all due to ongoing power outages.[15] Other lightbulb jokes might be responses to the current political power. For instance:
Q. How many Democrats does it take to change a light bulb?
A. None. Biden just says it's fixed, and the rest of them sit in the dark and applaud.[16]
The Village Voice held a $200 lightbulb joke contest around the time of the Iran hostage crisis, with the winning joke being:[17]Q. How many Iranians does it take to change a light bulb?
A. You send us the prize money and we'll tell you the answer.
Lightbulb jokes can also be about sports, teasing about their team's past, future, etc.
Q.  How many Liverpool fans does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
 A.  They don't, they just talk about how good the old one was.
Lightbulb jokes can also be related to religious groups and denominations.
Q. Why is it easier for a Pentecostal to change a light bulb?
A. Because their hands are already up.
