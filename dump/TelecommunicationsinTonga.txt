Broadband internet communication is provided by the Tonga Cable System that went online in April 2018.[4]
On 15 January 2022, following a volcanic eruption on the island of Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai, the Tonga Cable System was severed, leaving the country without Internet access.[5] Using a satellite dish at the University of the South Pacific, the telecommunications company Digicel is providing limited 2G coverage to the island of Tongatapu, as well as giving residents free SIM cards.[6][7]
Until 2002, the Auckland-based Pasifika Times was also circulated in Niue.
