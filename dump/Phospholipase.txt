Phospholipase,
A phospholipase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phospholipids[1] into fatty acids and other lipophilic substances. Acids trigger the release of bound calcium from cellular stores and the consequent increase in free cytosolic Ca2+, an essential step in calcium signaling to regulate intracellular processes.[2] There are four major classes, termed A, B, C, and D, which are distinguished by the type of reaction which they catalyze:
Types C and D are considered phosphodiesterases.
Endothelial lipase is primarily a phospholipase.[3]
Phospholipase A2 acts on the intact lecithin molecule and hydrolyzes the fatty acid esterified to the second carbon atom. The resulting products are lysolecithin and a fatty acid. Phospholipase A2 is an enzyme present in the venom of bees, blennies and viper snakes.[4]
