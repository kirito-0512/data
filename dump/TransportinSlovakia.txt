Most towns and cities in Slovakia have well-developed bus networks. Most of the buses are operated by the city or town council but most regional buses are operated by private operators with the permission of local authorities or the county council. There is also a trolleybus system which only operates in large cities and is operated by the town council. They are more of an ecological system of transport than a standard bus

Trams are only found in Bratislava and Kosice. The first tram to arrive in Slovakia was in 1895 in Bratislava and then later on in 1913 trams arrived in Kosice. Today the tram network is expanding rapidly in both cities.
