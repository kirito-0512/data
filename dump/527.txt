Year 527 (DXXVII) was a common year starting on Friday (the link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Mavortius without Colleague (or, less frequently, year 1280 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 527 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
