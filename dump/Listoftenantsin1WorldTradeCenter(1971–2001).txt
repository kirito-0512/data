The original 1 World Trade Center (also known as the North Tower, Tower 1, Building One, or 1 WTC) was one of the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center in New York City. It was completed in 1972, stood at a height of 1,368 feet (417 m), and was the tallest building in the world until 1973, when surpassed by the Sears Tower (now Willis Tower) in Chicago.
It was distinguishable from its twin, the original 2 World Trade Center, also known as the South Tower, by the 362-foot (110 m) telecommunications antenna on its roof. Including the antenna, the building stood at a total height of 1,730 feet (530 m). Other things that made the North Tower distinguishable from its twin was a canopy connected to the North Tower's west facade on street level as well as two pedestrian walkways that extended from the west and south promenades of Three and Six World Trade Center to the North Tower's north and south facades on plaza level, all of which the South Tower lacked. The building's address was 1 World Trade Center, and the WTC complex had its own ZIP code (10048) due to its large size.
The original World Trade Center was destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Struck by American Airlines Flight 11 at 8:46 a.m., the North Tower was the first of the Twin Towers to be hit by a hijacked aircraft, and the second to collapse, at 10:28 a.m. The North Tower stood for 102 minutes after the aircraft impact. Of the 2,977 victims killed in the attacks, around 1,600 were in the North Tower or on the ground.
The North Tower was replaced by the present-day One World Trade Center tower, which was opened in November 2014 as the lead building of the redeveloped World Trade Center site.[3][4]

The 92nd floor, though technically the first floor below Flight 11's impact zone, did not have any survivors.[8] Sixty-nine people reported to work that morning, including 67 employees of Carr Futures, a tenant on the 92nd floor. The impact itself spared every single person on Floor 92 and did no damage to the floor directly. However, the force of the crash collapsed walls and inflicted nonstructural damage such as smashed windows,[9] broken ceiling tiles and severed electrical wires, as well as causing knee-deep flooding throughout various rooms on the 92nd floor after the water pipes burst. Multiple calls were recorded from people trapped on the floor, the workers reporting that although the stairs on the 92nd floor had not been destroyed, they were walled off by fallen debris from Flight 11's impact directly above.[10] In addition to the stairs being rendered impassable, the centralized impact into the North Tower's core also interrupted elevator service in the skyscraper from its 50th floor and higher, severing all escape routes for anyone above the 91st floor.[11]
Initially, conditions on the 92nd floor were likely not dissimilar to what they were on the 91st, from which everyone survived and escaped.[12] The situation changed very quickly when flammable aviation fuel spilled down into the 92nd floor, igniting fires that rapidly began consuming its east side; within 12 minutes of the impact, the first known fatalities from the floor occurred over a period of less than two minutes when eight workers killed themselves by jumping from the tower to escape the rapidly advancing wall of flames.[13]
Those who remained made their way to an unoccupied area on the west side of the floor that was initially free of smoke and fire. However, images show that the blaze on the tower’s north face eventually spread westward to their safe haven in that section of the floor, making conditions there unsurvivable.[14]
The last phone call from the North Tower came from Thomas McGinnis, a trader on the 92nd floor, when he got through to his wife Iliana at 10:18. McGinnis and a number of others had been trapped in a conference room the entire time after the door jammed shut from the building buckling as the plane hit, separating them from everyone else on the floor. Most of the floor was engulfed in flames by the time McGinnis called, with extremely limited space for the group to avoid being burned.[15]
Despite his wife's attempts to reassure him, McGinnis did not believe they would survive. The South Tower had already collapsed, and McGinnis revealed to her that he could see people jumping from the floors above. The connection dropped at 10:26, two minutes before the tower collapsed, which killed everyone else on the 92nd floor instantly.[16]
Between 1978 and 1995, the Consulate of Paraguay was located in Suite 1609 of 1 World Trade Center.[17][18] Home Lines once occupied Suite 3969.[19]
