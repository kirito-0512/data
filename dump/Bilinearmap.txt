Bilinearmap,
In mathematics, a bilinear map is a function combining elements of two vector spaces to yield an element of a third vector space, and is linear in each of its arguments. Matrix multiplication is an example.
Let 
V
,
W
{\displaystyle V,W}
 and 
X
{\displaystyle X}
 be three vector spaces over the same base field 
F
{\displaystyle F}
. A bilinear map is a function
B
:
V
×
W
→
X
{\displaystyle B:V\times W\to X}
such that for all 
w
∈
W
{\displaystyle w\in W}
, the map 
B
w
{\displaystyle B_{w}}
v
↦
B
(
v
,
w
)
{\displaystyle v\mapsto B(v,w)}
is a linear map from 
V
{\displaystyle V}
 to 
X
,
{\displaystyle X,}
 and for all 
v
∈
V
{\displaystyle v\in V}
, the map 
B
v
{\displaystyle B_{v}}
w
↦
B
(
v
,
w
)
{\displaystyle w\mapsto B(v,w)}
is a linear map from 
W
{\displaystyle W}
 to 
X
.
{\displaystyle X.}
 In other words, when we hold the first entry of the bilinear map fixed while letting the second entry vary, the result is a linear operator, and similarly for when we hold the second entry fixed.
Such a map 
B
{\displaystyle B}
 satisfies the following properties.
If 
V
=
W
{\displaystyle V=W}
 and we have B(v, w) = B(w, v) for all 
v
,
w
∈
V
,
{\displaystyle v,w\in V,}
 then we say that B is symmetric.  If X is the base field F, then the map is called a bilinear form, which are well-studied (for example: scalar product, inner product, and quadratic form).
The definition works without any changes if instead of vector spaces over a field F, we use modules over a commutative ring R. It generalizes to n-ary functions, where the proper term is multilinear.
For non-commutative rings R and S, a left R-module M and a right S-module N, a bilinear map is a map B : M × N → T with T an (R, S)-bimodule, and for which any n in N, m ↦ B(m, n) is an R-module homomorphism, and for any m in M, n ↦ B(m, n) is an S-module homomorphism.  This satisfies
for all m in M, n in N, r in R and s in S, as well as B being additive in each argument.
An immediate consequence of the definition is that B(v, w) = 0X whenever v = 0V or w = 0W. This may be seen by writing the zero vector 0V as 0 ⋅ 0V (and similarly for 0W) and moving the scalar 0 "outside", in front of B, by linearity.
The set L(V, W; X) of all bilinear maps is a linear subspace of the space (viz. vector space, module) of all maps from V × W into X.
If V, W, X are finite-dimensional, then so is L(V, W; X). For 
X
=
F
,
{\displaystyle X=F,}
 that is, bilinear forms, the dimension of this space is dim V × dim W (while the space L(V × W; F) of linear forms is of dimension dim V + dim W). To see this, choose a basis for V and W; then each bilinear map can be uniquely represented by the matrix B(ei, fj), and vice versa. 
Now, if X is a space of higher dimension, we obviously have dim L(V, W; X) = dim V × dim W × dim X.
Suppose 
X
,
Y
,
{\displaystyle X,Y,}
 and 
Z
{\displaystyle Z}
 are topological vector spaces and let 
b
:
X
×
Y
→
Z
{\displaystyle b:X\times Y\to Z}
 be a bilinear map. 
Then b is said to be separately continuous if the following two conditions hold:
Many separately continuous bilinear that are not continuous satisfy an additional property: hypocontinuity.[1] 
All continuous bilinear maps are hypocontinuous.
Many bilinear maps that occur in practice are separately continuous but not all are continuous. 
We list here sufficient conditions for a separately continuous bilinear to be continuous.
Let 
X
,
Y
,
 and 
Z
{\displaystyle X,Y,{\text{ and }}Z}
 be locally convex Hausdorff spaces and let 
C
:
L
(
X
;
Y
)
×
L
(
Y
;
Z
)
→
L
(
X
;
Z
)
{\displaystyle C:L(X;Y)\times L(Y;Z)\to L(X;Z)}
 be the composition map defined by 
C
(
u
,
v
)
:=
v
∘
u
.
{\displaystyle C(u,v):=v\circ u.}
In general, the bilinear map 
C
{\displaystyle C}
 is not continuous (no matter what topologies the spaces of linear maps are given). 
We do, however, have the following results:
Give all three spaces of linear maps one of the following topologies:
