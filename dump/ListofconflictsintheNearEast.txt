ListofconflictsintheNearEast,


This is a list of conflicts in the Near East arranged; first, chronologically from the epipaleolithic until the end of the late modern period (c. 20,000 years Before Present – c. AD 1945); second, geographically by sub-regions (starting from east to west; then, south to north). This list includes most present-day sovereign states (some of which may be disputed) beginning eastward from West and Central Asia (the Republic of Iraq, State of Kuwait, and Islamic republics of Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan), Syria (the Syrian Arab Republic and Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan), Transcaucasia (the republics of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Abkhazia, Artsakh, and South Ossetia), Anatolia and Eastern Thrace (the Republic of Turkey), Arabian Peninsula (the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, State of Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Sultanate of Oman, and Republic of Yemen), Levant (the Lebanese Republic, Republic of Cyprus, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, and the states of Israel and Palestine), Northeast Africa (the Arab Republic of Egypt and Republic of the Sudan), and Northwest Africa (the State of Libya, Republic of Tunisia, People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, Kingdom of Morocco, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, and Islamic Republic of Mauritania). Also listed might be any raid, strike, skirmish, siege, sacking, and/or battle (both land and naval) that occurred on the territories of a modern country occupying what may today be referred to as the "Middle East" (or the "Ancient Near East" when in reference to this region's military history during classical antiquity); however, was itself only part of an operation of a campaign in a theater of a greater, interregional war (e.g. any and/or all border, undeclared, colonial, proxy, liberation, world wars, etc.) There may also be periods of violent, civil unrest listed; such as, shootouts, spree killings, massacres, terrorist attacks, coups, assassinations, regicides, riots, rebellions, revolutions, and civil wars (as well as wars of succession and/or independence). The list might also contain episodes of human sacrifice, mass suicide, and ethnic cleansing/genocide.
