DemographicsoftheDominicanRepublic,
This is a demography of the population of the Dominican Republic including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
The area was first included in world trade in 1492 where Christopher Columbus docked on the island of Hispaniola.
When Spain occupied the country in 1496, the population consisted of Arawak (Taíno Indians). When Spain returned in 1496, they founded the current capital, Santo Domingo, as the first European city in America. The country came under Spanish rule. France took over the part of Hispaniola that is today Haiti. During the colony era, The Dominican Republic acted as a sugar supplier to Spain and France. Many whites moved to the country during this period.
In 1496, Santo Domingo was built and became the new capital, and remains the oldest continuously inhabited European city in the Americas.
Today, two other large groups have joined, while the indigenous population has mostly disappeared. 45% of Dominicans consider themselves Endemic, 18% are white, 16% are black and 9% are mulatto. During the many years that have passed since the great immigration, the races have been mixed and it can be difficult to distinguish. In terms of race, they are all similar to the other Caribbean islands. The Spaniards brought Christianity to the Dominican Republic, and today about 50% of the population reports as being Catholic. One clear remnant of the Spanish colonial era on the population is the official and widespread use of the Spanish language.
According to the 2022 revision of the World Population Prospects[2][3] the total population was 11,117,873 in 2021, compared to 2,380,000 in 1950.
