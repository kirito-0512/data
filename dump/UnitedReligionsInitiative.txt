The United Religions Initiative (URI) is a global grassroots interfaith network.
It has local and global initiatives through more than 800 member groups and organizations, called Cooperation Circles,[1] to engage in community action such as conflict resolution and reconciliation, environmental sustainability, education, women's and youth programs, and advocacy for human rights.[2]
The organization was founded by William E. Swing, along with David Cooperrider and Diana Whitney.[3] The URI Charter was signed by more than 200 people present, and hundreds more joining over the Internet, at a ceremony in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US, on June 26, 2000.[4]
URI also holds consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).[5]
Before the formal charter signing in 2000, URI supporters around the world participated together in a project called "72 Hours for Peace", in which more than 250 local organizations united in projects promoting peace and justice during the turn of the millennium.[6]
