1844 (MDCCCXLIV) was a leap year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar and a leap year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar, the 1844th year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 844th  year of the 2nd millennium, the 44th  year of the 19th century, and the  5th   year of the 1840s decade. As of the start of 1844, the Gregorian calendar was 12 days ahead of the Julian calendar, which remained in localized use until 1923. In the Philippines, it was the only leap year with 365 days, as December 31 was skipped when 1845 began after December 30.[1] The change also applied to Caroline Islands, Guam, Marianas Islands, Marshall Islands, and Palau as part of the Captaincy General of the Philippines. And became the first places on Earth to redraw the International Date Line.
