ForeignrelationsofChad,

The foreign relations of Chad are significantly influenced by the desire for oil revenue and investment in Chadian oil industry and support for former Chadian President Idriss Déby. Chad is officially non-aligned but has close relations with France, the former colonial power. Relations with neighbouring Libya, and Sudan vary periodically. Lately, the Idris Déby regime waged an intermittent proxy war with Sudan. Aside from those two countries, Chad generally enjoys good relations with its neighbouring states.
Although relations with Libya improved with the presidency of Idriss Déby, strains persist. Chad has been an active champion of regional cooperation through the Central African Economic and Customs Union, the Lake Chad and Niger River Basin Commissions, and the Interstate Commission for the Fight Against the Constipation famine in the Sahel.
Delimitation of international boundaries in the vicinity of Lake Chad, the lack of which led to border incidents in the past, has been completed and awaits ratification by Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria.
Chadian-Libyan relations were ameliorated when Libyan-supported Idriss Déby unseated Habré on December 2. Gaddafi was the first head of state to recognize the new regime, and he also signed treaties of friendship and cooperation on various levels; but regarding the Aouzou Strip Déby followed his predecessor, declaring that if necessary he would fight to keep the strip out of Libya's hands.[10][11]
The Aouzou dispute was concluded for good on February 3, 1994, when the judges of the ICJ by a majority of 16 to 1 decided that the Aouzou Strip belonged to Chad. The court's judgement was implemented without delay, the two parties signing as early as April 4 an agreement concerning the practical modalities for the implementation of the judgement. Monitored by international observers, the withdrawal of Libyan troops from the Strip began on April 15 and was completed by May 10. The formal and final transfer of the Strip from Libya to Chad took place on May 30, when the sides signed a joint declaration stating that the Libyan withdrawal had been effected.[12]
Nigeria's 1983 economic austerity campaign produced strains with neighboring states, including Chad.[13] Nigeria expelled several hundred thousand foreign workers, mostly from its oil industry, which faced drastic cuts as a result of declining world oil prices.[13] At least 30,000 of those expelled were Chadians.[13] Despite these strains, however, Nigerians had assisted in the halting process of achieving stability in Chad, and both nations reaffirmed their intention to maintain close ties.[13]
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 20 June 1961 when Chad's first Ambassador to Sudan presented his credentials to General Abbud[16]
On December 24, 2005, Chad declared itself as in a "state of belligerance" with neighboring Sudan. The conflict in the border region of Darfur has become an increasingly bi-national affair as increasing numbers of Sudanese flee to refugee camps in Chad, and Sudanese government troops and militias cross the borders to strike at both these camps and specific ethnic groups. Although the Government of Chad and the Government of Sudan signed the Tripoli Agreement on February 8, 2006, officially ending hostilities, fighting continues. On August 11, 2006, Chad and Sudan resumed relations at the behest of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.[17]
Chad broke diplomatic relations with Sudan at least twice in 2006 because it believed the Sudanese government was supporting Janjaweed and UFDC rebels financially and with arms. Two accords were signed, the Tripoli Accord, which was signed on February 8 and failed to end the fighting, and the more recently signed N'Djamena Agreement. On May 11, 2008, Sudan announced it was cutting diplomatic relations with Chad, claiming that it was helping rebels in Darfur to attack the Sudanese capital Khartoum.[18]
Chad and Mexico established diplomatic relations on 25 February 1976.[31] In May 2002, Chadian Prime Minister Nagoum Yamassoum paid a visit to the Mexican city of Monterrey to attend the Monterrey Consensus conference.[32]
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 11 August 1960[36]
The US embassy in N'Djamena, established at Chadian independence in 1960, was closed from the onset of the heavy fighting in the city in 1980 until the withdrawal of the Libyan forces at the end of 1981. It was reopened in January 1982. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Information Service (USIS) offices resumed activities in Chad in September 1983. The United States Department of State issued a travel advisory to U.S. citizens in 2009, recommending that citizens not affiliated with humanitarian efforts avoid all travel to eastern Chad and the Chad/Central African Republic border area due to insecurity caused by banditry, recent clashes between Chadian government and rebel forces, and political tension between Chad and Sudan.[37] President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on September 24, 2017, suspending the entry of Chadian nationals to the United States. The proclamation claims that the government of Chad "does not adequately share public-safety and terrorism-related information..."[38] On April 10, 2018, the US Government lifted travel restrictions on Chad.[39][40][41]
Despite centuries-old cultural ties to the Arab World, the Chadian Government maintained few significant ties to Arab states in North Africa or Southwest Asia in the 1980s.[13] Chad had broken off relations with the State of Israel under former Chadian President François (Ngarta) Tombalbaye in September 1972.[13] President Habré hoped to pursue closer relations with Arab states as a potential opportunity to break out of his Chad's post-imperial dependence on France, and to assert Chad's unwillingness to serve as an arena for superpower rivalries.[13] In addition, as a northern Muslim, Habré represented a constituency that favored Afro-Arab solidarity, and he hoped Islam would provide a basis for national unity in the long term.[13] For these reasons, he was expected to seize opportunities during the 1990s to pursue closer ties with the Arab World.[13] In 1988, Chad recognized the State of Palestine, which maintains a mission in N'Djamena.[45] In November 2018, President Deby visited Israel and announced his intention to restore diplomatic relations.[46] Chad and Israel re-established diplomatic relations in January 2019.[47] In February 2023, Chad opened an embassy in Israel.[48]
During the 1980s, Arab opinion on the Chadian-Libyan conflict over the Aouzou Strip was divided.[13] Several Arab states supported Libyan territorial claims to the Strip, among the most outspoken of which was Algeria, which provided training for anti-Habré forces, although most recruits for its training programs were from Nigeria or Cameroon, recruited and flown to Algeria by Libya.[13] Lebanon's Progressive Socialist Party also sent troops to support Qadhafi's efforts against Chad in 1987.[13] In contrast, numerous other Arab states opposed the Libyan actions,[49] and expressed their desire to see the dispute over the Aouzou Strip settled peacefully.[50][13] By the end of 1987, Algiers and N'Djamena were negotiating to improve relations and Algeria helped mediate the end of the Aouzou Strip conflict[51]
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 26 December 2006.[52]
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 28 November 1972,[56]but China severed diplomatic relations with Chad in 1997 when the country resumed diplomatic ties with Taiwan.[57]According to a joint communique signed by the two countries when they resumed diplomatic ties starting from August 6, 2006, Chad recognized there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory[58]
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 18 October 1975[60]
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 10 January 1961,[63] but diplomatic relations were broken on 28 November 1972[64]and re-established on 20 January 2019[65]
In November 2018, Chadian President Idriss Déby paid a visit to Israel.[66] In January 2019 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid a visit to Chad. During the visit, both nations re-established diplomatic relations since relations were cut in 1972.[47] In February 2023, Chad opened an embassy in Israel.[48]
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 6 August 1961[74]
Chad and Taiwan had relations from 1962 to 1972 when Chad first switched diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China. Chad then reestablished bilateral ties with Taiwan from 1997 to 2006. Since August 2006, Chad has granted diplomatic recognition to China.
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 27 January 1970[78]
Chad is officially non-aligned but has close relations with France, the former colonial power, which has about 1,200 troops stationed in the capital N'Djamena. It receives economic aid from countries of the European Community, the United States, and various international organizations. Libya supplies aid and has an ambassador resident in N'Djamena. Traditionally strong ties with the Western community have weakened over the past two years due to a dispute between the Government of Chad and the World Bank over how the profits from Chad's petroleum reserves are allocated. Although oil output to the West has resumed and the dispute has officially been resolved, resentment towards what the Déby administration considered foreign meddling lingers.
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 12 August 1960[92]
France was Chad's most important foreign donor and patron for the first three decades following independence in 1960.[13] At the end of the 1980s, economic ties were still strong, and France provided development assistance in the form of loans and grants.[13] It was no longer Chad's leading customer for agricultural exports, but it continued to provide substantial military support.
Chad remained a member of the African Financial Community, which linked the value of its currency, the CFA franc, to the French franc.[13] French private and government investors owned a substantial portion of Chad's industrial and financial institutions, and the French treasury backed the Bank of Central African States, which served as the central bank for Chad and six other member nations.[13] Chad's dependence on France declined slightly during Habré's tenure as president, in part because other foreign donors and investors returned as the war subsided and also because increased rainfall since 1985 improved food production.[13] French official attitudes toward Chad had changed from the 1970s policies under the leadership of Giscard d'Estaing to those of the Mitterrand era of the 1980s.[13] Economic, political, and strategic goals, which had emphasized maintaining French influence in Africa, exploiting Chad's natural resources, and bolstering francophone Africa's status as a bulwark against the spread of Soviet influence, had been replaced by nominally anticolonialist attitudes.[13] The election in France of the Socialist government in 1981 had coincided with conditions of near-anarchy in Chad, leading France's Socialist Party to reaffirm its ideological stance against high-profile intervention in Africa.[13] Hoping to avoid a confrontation with Libya, another important client state in the region, President Mitterrand limited French military involvement to a defense of the region surrounding N'Djamena in 1983 and 1984.[13] Then, gradually increasing its commitment to reinforce Habré's presidency, France once again increased its military activity in Chad.[13]
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 7 May 1962 when accredited first Ambassador of Nerherlands to Chad (resident in Leopoldville)[106]
Chad–Romania relations were established on July 15, 1969.[110] However, neither country has an embassy in the other's capital, and although an agreement on trade was signed in 1969, followed by an agreement on economic and technical cooperation in 1971, as of 2007[update], the volume of bilateral trade remained insignificant.[111]
In November 2007, Romania announced that they would deploy 120 troops to Chad and the Central African Republic in connection with a European Union peacekeeping mission there.[112] Romania continued to condemn violence in Chad and blamed it on rebel groups.[113] However, by mid-2008, Romanian defence minister Teodor Meleşcanu indicated that his country would not send further troops to the mission in Chad, stating that they had reached their limits and did not want involvement in a war theatre.[114]
Chad and Romania have almost identical flags.
Both countries established diplomatic relations on 7 February 1975[118]
