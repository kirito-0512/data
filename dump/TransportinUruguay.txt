The programme will cost $30m.[2]

The traditional fuel stations were Ancap, Esso, Shell and Texaco. In 2005–2006, Petrobras bought the 90 Shell stations. In 2006–2007, Ancap bought the 90 Texaco stations. In 2011, Bridas bought the Esso stations but kept the brand.[citation needed]

The country is primarily served by the Carrasco International Airport in Canelones Department, next to the limit with Montevideo.
