Well-orderingtheorem,
In mathematics, the well-ordering theorem, also known as Zermelo's theorem, states that every set can be well-ordered. A set X is well-ordered by a strict total order if every non-empty subset of X has a least element under the ordering. The well-ordering theorem together with Zorn's lemma are the most important mathematical statements that are equivalent to the axiom of choice (often called AC, see also Axiom of choice § Equivalents).[1][2] Ernst Zermelo introduced the axiom of choice as an "unobjectionable logical principle" to prove the well-ordering theorem.[3] One can conclude from the well-ordering theorem that every set is susceptible to transfinite induction, which is considered by mathematicians to be a powerful technique.[3] One famous consequence of the theorem is the Banach–Tarski paradox.
Georg Cantor considered the well-ordering theorem to be a "fundamental principle of thought".[4]  However, it is considered difficult or even impossible to visualize a well-ordering of 




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }

; such a visualization would have to incorporate the axiom of choice.[5] In 1904, Gyula Kőnig claimed to have proven that such a well-ordering cannot exist.  A few weeks later, Felix Hausdorff found a mistake in the proof.[6]  It turned out, though, that in first-order logic the well-ordering theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice, in the sense that the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms with the axiom of choice included are sufficient to prove the well-ordering theorem, and conversely, the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms without the axiom of choice but with the well-ordering theorem included are sufficient to prove the axiom of choice. (The same applies to Zorn's lemma.) In second-order logic, however, the well-ordering theorem is strictly stronger than the axiom of choice: from the well-ordering theorem one may deduce the axiom of choice, but from the axiom of choice one cannot deduce the well-ordering theorem.[7]

There is a well-known joke about the three statements, and their relative amenability to intuition:The axiom of choice is obviously true, the well-ordering principle obviously false, and who can tell about Zorn's lemma?[8]
The well-ordering theorem follows from the axiom of choice as follows.[9]Let the set we are trying to well-order be 



A


{\displaystyle A}

, and let 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 be a choice function for the family of non-empty subsets of 



A


{\displaystyle A}

. For every ordinal 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

, define a set 




a

α




{\displaystyle a_{\alpha }}

 that is in 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 by setting 




a

α


 
=
 
f
(
A
∖
{

a

ξ


∣
ξ
<
α
}
)


{\displaystyle a_{\alpha }\ =\ f(A\smallsetminus \{a_{\xi }\mid \xi <\alpha \})}

 if this complement 



A
∖
{

a

ξ


∣
ξ
<
α
}


{\displaystyle A\smallsetminus \{a_{\xi }\mid \xi <\alpha \}}

 is nonempty, or leave 




a

α




{\displaystyle a_{\alpha }}

 undefined if it is. That is, 




a

α




{\displaystyle a_{\alpha }}

 is chosen from the set of elements of 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 that have not yet been assigned a place in the ordering (or undefined if the entirety of 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 has been successfully enumerated). Then 



⟨

a

α


∣

a

α



 is defined

⟩


{\displaystyle \langle a_{\alpha }\mid a_{\alpha }{\text{ is defined}}\rangle }

 is a well-order of 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 as desired.The axiom of choice can be proven from the well-ordering theorem as follows.
An essential point of this proof is that it involves only a single arbitrary choice, that of 



R


{\displaystyle R}

; applying the well-ordering theorem to each member 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 of 



E


{\displaystyle E}

 separately would not work, since the theorem only asserts the existence of a well-ordering, and choosing for each 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 a well-ordering would require just as many choices as simply choosing an element from each 



S


{\displaystyle S}

. Particularly, if 



E


{\displaystyle E}

 contains uncountably many sets, making all uncountably many choices is not allowed under the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice.
