1890s,
The 1890s (pronounced "eighteen-nineties") was a decade of the Gregorian calendar that began on January 1, 1890, and ended on December 31, 1899. It is characterized by an international economic recovery following the Long Depression (1873—1896) and by the beginning of strong economic growth during the Belle Époque (1896—1914), driven by the innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution (i.e. electricity, gasoline, automobiles, artificial textiles, organic chemistry). The First Sino-Japanese War (1894—95) and the Spanish–American War (1898) respectively marked the accession of Japan and the United States to the rank of great world powers. The decade saw the apogee of the coal-powered steam engine, which would subsequently be dethroned by the reciprocating engine, powered by refined petroleum. The supremacy of this new source of energy was confirmed when the world's first fleet, the Royal Navy, decided in 1910 to supply all its vessels with fuel oil.
In the United States, the 1890s were marked by a severe economic depression sparked by the Panic of 1893. This economic crisis would help bring about the end of the so-called "Gilded Age", and coincided with numerous strikes in the industrial workforce. From 1926 the period was sometimes referred to as the "Mauve Decade", because William Henry Perkin's  aniline dye (discovered in London in 1856) allowed the widespread use of that colour in fashion[1][2] in the late 1850s and early 1860s.[3]
In the British Empire the 1890s epitomised the late Victorian period.
