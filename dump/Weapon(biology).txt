Weapon(biology),
In biology, weapons are traits that are used most often by males to fight one another off for access to mates. A mate is won in battle either by a male chasing off a fellow competitor or killing it off, usually leaving the victor as the only option for the female to reproduce with.[1] However, because stronger organisms, whether mentally or physically, are usually favored in combat, this also leads to the evolution of stronger organisms in species that use combat as a way to secure mates, via intrasexual selection.[2] Examples of weapons include: antlers, horns, and ossicones.
Antlers of red deer
Horns of impala
Ossicones of giraffe
Horn-like projections of chameleon
