Dolichocephaly,
Dolichocephaly (derived from the Ancient Greek δολιχός 'long' and κεφαλή 'head') is a condition where the head is longer than would be expected,[1] relative to its width. In humans, scaphocephaly is a form of dolichocephaly.
Dolichocephalic dogs (such as the Lurcher or German Shepherd) have elongated noses. This makes them vulnerable to fungal diseases of the nose such as aspergillosis.[2] In humans the anterior–posterior diameter (length) of dolichocephaly head is more than the transverse diameter (width).[citation needed]
It can be present in cases of Sensenbrenner syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Sotos syndrome,[3] CMFTD[4] and Marfan syndrome. Dolichocephaly may also occur non-pathologically as a result of normal variation between human populations. The standards for denoting dolichocephaly are derived from Caucasian anatomy norms, and thus describing dolichocephaly as a medical condition in some cases may fail to reflect the diversity in different human populations.[5]
