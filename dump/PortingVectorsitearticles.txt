This page tracked which documents and versions were imported from http://www.vectorsite.net/ (since moved to https://vc.airvectors.net/) into Wikipedia. Vectorsite is in the public domain, and can therefore be copied and adapted for Wikipedia articles, but is, along with its author, otherwise unconnected to Wikipedia.
