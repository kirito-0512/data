EconomyoftheCookIslands,
The economy of the Cook Islands is based mainly on tourism, with minor exports made up of tropical and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit-processing, clothing and handicrafts.
As in many other South Pacific nations, the Cook Islands's economy is hindered by the country's isolation from foreign markets, lack of natural resources aside from fish, periodic devastation from natural disasters, and inadequate infrastructure.
Trade deficits are made up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid, overwhelmingly from New Zealand. Efforts to exploit tourism potential, encourage offshore banking, and expand the mining and fishing industries have been partially successful in stimulating investment and growth.
Banks in the Cook Islands are regulated under the Banking Act 2011.[1] Banks must be licensed and are supervised by the Cook Islands Financial Supervisory Commission.[2]
The Cook Islands developed an offshore financial services industry in the early 1980s.[3] Allegations that New Zealand-based companies were using it as a tax haven led to the Winebox Inquiry in New Zealand in the 1990s, and in 2000 it was listed as a tax haven by the OECD.[4] In 2002 it was delisted after it agreed to fiscal transparency and to exchange tax information.[5][6] Allegations of being a tax haven re-emerged in 2013 following the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists Offshore Leaks.[7][8] Trusts incorporated in the Cook Islands are used to provide anonymity and asset-protection.[9] The Cook Islands also featured in the Panama Papers,[10] Paradise Papers,[11][12] and Pandora Papers[13][14] financial leaks.
Economist Vaine Nooana-Arioka has been executive director of the Bank of the Cook Islands since 2008.[15]
