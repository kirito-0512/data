Heisuke Hironaka (広中 平祐, Hironaka Heisuke, born April 9, 1931) is a Japanese mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1970 for his contributions to algebraic geometry.[1]
Hironaka entered Kyoto University in 1949. After completing his undergraduate studies at Kyoto University, he received his Ph.D. in 1960 from Harvard University while under the direction of Oscar Zariski.[2][3]
Hironaka held teaching positions at Brandeis University from 1960-1963, Columbia University in 1964, and Kyoto University from 1975 to 1988.[4] He was a professor of mathematics at Harvard University from 1968 until becoming emeritus in 1992 and was a president of Yamaguchi University from 1996 to 2002.[5]
In 1964, Hironaka proved that singularities of algebraic varieties admit resolutions in characteristic zero.[6] This means that any algebraic variety can be replaced by (more precisely is birationally equivalent to) a similar variety which has no singularities. He also introduced Hironaka's example showing that a deformation of Kähler manifolds need not be Kähler.[7] In 2017 he posted to his personal webpage a manuscript that claims to prove the existence of a resolution of singularities in positive characteristic.[8]
Hironaka was awarded the Fields Medal in 1970.[9]
Hironaka has been active in raising funds for causes such as mathematical education.[10] His wife Wakako Hironaka is a politician. His daughter, Eriko Hironaka, is also a mathematician and focuses on low-dimensional topology and geometric topology.[11]
