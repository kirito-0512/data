TuringAward,

The ACM A. M. Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for contributions of lasting and major technical importance to computer science.[2] It is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science and is colloquially known as or often referred to as the "Nobel Prize of Computing".[3][4][5][6]
The award is named after Alan Turing, who was a British mathematician and reader in mathematics at the University of Manchester. Turing is often credited as being the key founder of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.[7] From 2007 to 2013, the award was accompanied by an additional prize of US$250,000, with financial support provided by Intel and Google.[2] Since 2014, the award has been accompanied by a prize of US$1 million, with financial support provided by Google.[1][8]
The first recipient, in 1966, was Alan Perlis, of Carnegie Mellon University. The first female recipient was Frances E. Allen of IBM in 2006.[9] The latest recipient, in 2022, is Robert Metcalfe for inventing Ethernet.
