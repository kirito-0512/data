Caddie,
In golf or disc golf, a caddie (or caddy) is the person who mainly carries a player's bag and clubs or discs, and gives the player advice and moral support.
The Scots word caddie or cawdy was derived in the 17th century from the French word cadet and originally meant a student military officer. It later came to refer to someone who did odd jobs.[1][2] By the 19th century, it had come to mean someone who carried clubs for a golfer, or in its shortened form, cad, a man of disreputable behaviour.[3]
The first recorded use of a caddie was in Edinburgh in 1681 by the future James II of England when taking part in the first international golf contest.[4][better source needed]

Caddies have been depicted in television, films, and books, including:
