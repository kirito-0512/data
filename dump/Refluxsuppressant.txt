Refluxsuppressant,
A reflux suppressant is any one of a number of drugs used to combat oesophageal reflux.[1][2] Commonly, following ingestion a 'raft' of alginic acid is created, floating on the stomach contents by carbon dioxide released by the drug. This forms a mechanical barrier to further reflux. Some preparations also contain antacids to protect the oesophagus.[3]
Reflux can also be coincidentally reduced by the motility stimulants and antidopaminergics.[citation needed]
