Romano Bruno Mussolini (26 September 1927 – 3 February 2006) was an Italian jazz pianist, painter, and film producer.[1] He was the fourth child and youngest son of Benito Mussolini.
Romano Mussolini was a native of Villa Carpena, Forlì (Emilia-Romagna), Romano Mussolini studied music as a child, playing classical pieces with his father on the violin. After World War II, he started playing jazz under the assumed name "Romano Full".[2]
His playing style has been described as "like a slightly melancholic Oscar Peterson. Occasionally inspired, he was always efficient; he made the refrains run on time."[3]
In 1962, Mussolini married Maria Scicolone, the younger sister of actress Sophia Loren. They had two daughters, Elisabetta and her elder sister Alessandra Mussolini, who was a member of the European Parliament, and led an Italian far-right party often described as neofascist, Alternativa Sociale. Romano Mussolini composed the party's official anthem, "The Pride of Being Italian".[3]
With his second wife, the actress Carla Maria Puccini, he had a third daughter, Rachele, named after his mother Rachele Mussolini. The younger Rachele has served as a member of the city council of Rome. [4]
Mussolini was very reserved about his family history. It was only in 2004 that he published a book, entitled Il Duce, mio padre (The Leader, my father), followed by a similar book in 2005, collecting personal memories and accounts of private confidences and discussions with his father.
Romano Mussolini died in 2006, aged 78, in a hospital in Rome from heart problems.
