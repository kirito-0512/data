EmperorJunna,
Emperor Junna (淳和天皇, Junna-tennō, c. 786 – 11 June 840) was the 53rd emperor of Japan,[1] according to the traditional order of succession.[2]  Junna reigned from 823 to 833.[3]
Junna had six empresses and imperial consorts and 13 imperial sons and daughters.[4]  His personal name (imina) was Ōtomo (大伴).[5]
Junna is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates Ōharano no Nishi no Minenoe no Misasagi (大原野西嶺上陵, Ōharano no Nishi no Minenoe Imperial Mausoleum), in Nishikyō-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Junna's mausoleum.[1]
The years of Junna's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name (nengō).[13]
Kugyō (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.[14]
In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Junna's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:
Empress: Imperial Princess Shōshi/Masako (正子内親王; 810–879), Emperor Saga's daughter
Hi (Empress as posthumous honors): Imperial Princess Koshi (高志内親王; 789–809), Emperor Kanmu's daughter
Court lady: Princess Otsugu (緒継女王; 787–847)
Nyogō: Nagahara no Motohime (永原原姫)
Nyogō: Tachibana no Ujiko (橘氏子), Tachibana no Nagana's daughter
Koui: Fujiwara no Kiyoko (藤原潔子), Fujiwara no Nagaoka's daughter
Court lady: Kiyohara no Haruko (清原春子), Kiyohara no Natsuno's daughter
Court lady: Ōnakatomi no Yasuko (大中臣安子), Ōnakatomi Fuchiio's daughter
Court lady: Ōno no Takako (大野鷹子), Ōno no Masao's daughter
Court lady: Tachibana no Funeko (橘船子), Tachibana no Kiyono's daughter
