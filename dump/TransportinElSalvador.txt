El Salvador has transport links by road, rail, sea and air.
El Salvador has over 10,000 km of roads, and one passenger rail service. There are several seaports on the Pacific Ocean, and two international airports.
A weekday passenger service links San Salvador and Apopa, a journey of 40 minutes.[1] Of a total of 602 km narrow gauge (3 ft (914 mm)) rail, much is abandoned. In November 2013 the government rail agency FENADESAL announced plans for development of four electrified railways serving San Salvador, Sitio del Niño (La Libertad), El Salvador International Airport, La Unión, and the Honduran frontier.[2]
The RN-21 (Bulevar Monseñor Romero) (East–West) is the very first freeway to be built in El Salvador and in Central America. The freeway passes the northern area of the city of Santa Tecla, La Libertad. It has a small portion serving Antiguo Cuscatlan, La Libertad, and merges with the RN-5 (Autopista Comalapa) (East–West, Boulevard de Los Proceres/Autopista del Aeropuerto) in San Salvador. 
The total length of the RN-21 is 9.95 kilometres (6.18 mi) and is currently working as a traffic reliever in the metropolitan area. The RN-21 was named in honor of Monseñor Romero. The first phase of the highway was completed in 2009, and the second phase in November 2012.
