Otterlo,
Otterlo is a village in the municipality of Ede of province of Gelderland in the Netherlands, in or near the Nationaal Park De Hoge Veluwe.
The Kröller-Müller Museum, named after Helene Kröller-Müller, is situated nearby and has the world's second largest collection of Vincent van Gogh paintings.
Otterlo was a separate municipality until 1818, when it merged with Ede.[3]
During the first four years of the war, Otterlo was relatively unharmed. The local resistance made use of a secret telephone connection from an electrician's house, which in 2021 still stands at the dorpsstraat, behind barber Prophitius, to communicate with the allies below the river Rhine (1944/1945). During the war, multiple families hid Jewish people from the Germans. One location was betrayed however, resulting in a raid in 1944 at the house 'De Lindenhof' at the Hoenderlooseweg.[4]
During the liberation of Netherlands in April 1945, Otterlo was the center of a fierce and bloody battle between German and British and Canadian soldiers. See the Battle of Otterlo.
