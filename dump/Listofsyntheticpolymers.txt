Listofsyntheticpolymers,
Some familiar household synthetic polymers include: Nylons in textiles and fabrics, Teflon in non-stick pans, Bakelite for electrical switches, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in pipes, etc. The common PET bottles are made of a synthetic polymer, polyethylene terephthalate. The plastic kits and covers are mostly made of synthetic polymers like polythene, and tires are manufactured from polybutadienes.[1] However, due to the environmental issues created by these synthetic polymers which are mostly non-biodegradable and often synthesized from petroleum, alternatives like bioplastics are also being considered. They are however expensive when compared to the synthetic polymers.[2]
Artificial polymer: Man-made polymer that is not a biopolymer.
Note 1: Artificial polymer should also be used in the case of chemicallymodified biopolymers.
Note 2: Biochemists are now capable of synthesizing copies of biopolymersthat should be named Synthetic biopolymer to make a distinctionwith true biopolymers.
Note 3: Genetic engineering is now capable of generating non-natural analoguesof biopolymers that should be referred to as artificial biopolymers, e.g.,artificial protein, artificial polynucleotide, etc.[3]
The eight most common types of synthetic organic polymers, which are commonly found in households are:
These polymers are often better known through their brand names, for instance:
