ListofmonarchsofPersia,


This is a list of monarchs of Persia (or monarchs of the Iranic peoples, in present-day Iran), some of whom were known by the royal title Shah or Shahanshah. This list starts from the establishment of the Medes around 671 BCE until the deposition of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979 CE.

Note: Ancient Persia is generally agreed to have ended with the collapse of the Achaemenid dynasty as a result of the Wars of Alexander the Great.
The Fratarakas appear to have been Governors of the Seleucid Empire.
The Seleucid dynasty gradually lost control of Persia. In 253, the Arsacid dynasty established itself in Parthia. The Parthians gradually expanded their control, until by the mid-2nd century BC, the Seleucids had completely lost control of Persia. Control of eastern territories was permanently lost by Antiochus VII in 129 BC.
