As you read and idly edit Wikipedia, at some point, you may ask yourself: "Just why is Wikipedia so great"? What accounts for its enormous growth and success?" To answer this question, some great people have written some explanations and arguments on this page. For comparison, see also Wikipedia: Why Wikipedia is not so great, and Wikipedia: Replies to common objections. You can then arrive at a well-informed conclusion thereafter.
