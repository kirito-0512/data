Listofhighest-grossingfilmsintheUnitedStatesandCanada,

The following is a list of the highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada, a market known in the film industry as the "North American box office",[1][2] and where "gross" is defined in US dollars.
This is a list of the highest-grossing films in the U.S. and Canada,[3] a market known in the film industry as the North American box office, or as the domestic box office within the U.S. itself.[1][2] The chart is ranked by lifetime gross, and for comparison, the figures adjusted for the effects of inflation are also listed, using the U.S. consumer price index;[4] a film's earnings from its initial release are also included to provide a basis for comparison between films released around the same time.
*  These films fall outside the top 100 when considering only initial gross, and would be replaced by The Twilight Saga: Eclipse ($300.53m) and The Twilight Saga: New Moon ($296.60m).
This chart ranks films by gross adjusted for ticket price inflation up to 2020 levels, based on data from Box Office Mojo, which was last updated in 2019 based on an average domestic movie ticket price of $9.01, and applying the Template:Inflation for the following years up to 2022 levels, due to the lack of updates on the original source.[7] It was compiled by multiplying the average ticket price in the current year by an estimate of the total number of admissions. Where the number of admissions is unknown, they are estimated by dividing the nominal gross by the average ticket price in the year of release to provide an estimate (taking re-releases into account).[8] Admissions better reflect the popularity of older films, since they are less susceptible to the effects of inflation.
Many of the films on this list were released prior to the availability of home video and have had multiple releases.
TNot including figures from 2023 releases.
