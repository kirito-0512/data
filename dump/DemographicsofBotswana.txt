The seven censuses of Botswana before its independence happened irregularly. Due to the Anglo-Boer War, the first census of Bechuanaland Protectorate, originally set to occur in 1901, took place on 17 April 1904.[4] The 1931 census was postponed to 1936 because of the Great Depression.[4] The early censuses were unreliable and took several years to tabulate; the results were outdated by the time they were calculated.
There have been six censuses after the independence of Botswana, each occurring every ten years in the year ending in 1 (i.e. 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2022). The 1971 census was the first census in Botswana to use de facto enumeration; this method counts people based on how many people spent census night at a specific location. Previously, the citizens were counted based on their usual place of residence. The 2001 census was the first census in Botswana to comply with the SADC 2000 Census Project, the guidelines of which unify the demographic statistics in southern Africa. The  2011 Census was the fifth census after independence  the 2011 Botswana Population and Housing Census, it occurred in August 2011. The most recent sixth  and most recent census is the 2022 Population and Housing Census which was carried out in April 2022.[7]
