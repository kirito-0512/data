Symplecticmanifold,

In differential geometry, a subject of mathematics, a symplectic manifold is a smooth manifold, 



M


{\displaystyle M}

, equipped with a closed nondegenerate differential 2-form 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

, called the symplectic form. The study of symplectic manifolds is called symplectic geometry or symplectic topology. Symplectic manifolds arise naturally in abstract formulations of classical mechanics and analytical mechanics as the cotangent bundles of manifolds. For example, in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, which provides one of the major motivations for the field, the set of all possible configurations of a system is modeled as a manifold, and this manifold's cotangent bundle describes the phase space of the system.
Symplectic manifolds arise from classical mechanics; in particular, they are a generalization of the phase space of a closed system.[1] In the same way the Hamilton equations allow one to derive the time evolution of a system from a set of differential equations, the symplectic form should allow one to obtain a vector field describing the flow of the system from the differential dH of a Hamiltonian function H.[2] So we require a linear map TM → T∗M from the tangent manifold TM to the cotangent manifold T∗M, or equivalently, an element of T∗M ⊗ T∗M. Letting ω denote a section of T∗M ⊗ T∗M, the requirement that ω be non-degenerate ensures that for every differential dH there is a unique corresponding vector field VH such that dH = ω(VH, · ). Since one desires the Hamiltonian to be constant along flow lines, one should have ω(VH, VH) = dH(VH) = 0, which implies that ω is alternating and hence a 2-form. Finally, one makes the requirement that ω should not change under flow lines, i.e. that the Lie derivative of ω along VH vanishes. Applying Cartan's formula, this amounts to (here

so that, on repeating this argument for different smooth functions

 such that the corresponding

A symplectic form on a smooth manifold 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 is a closed non-degenerate differential 2-form 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

.[3][4] Here, non-degenerate means that for every point 



p
∈
M


{\displaystyle p\in M}

, the skew-symmetric pairing on the tangent space 




T

p


M


{\displaystyle T_{p}M}

 defined by 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

 is non-degenerate. That is to say, if there exists an 



X
∈

T

p


M


{\displaystyle X\in T_{p}M}

 such that 



ω
(
X
,
Y
)
=
0


{\displaystyle \omega (X,Y)=0}

 for all 



Y
∈

T

p


M


{\displaystyle Y\in T_{p}M}

, then 



X
=
0


{\displaystyle X=0}

. Since in odd dimensions, skew-symmetric matrices are always singular, the requirement that 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

 be nondegenerate implies that 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 has an even dimension.[3][4] The closed condition means that the exterior derivative of 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

 vanishes. A symplectic manifold is a pair 



(
M
,
ω
)


{\displaystyle (M,\omega )}

 where 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 is a smooth manifold and 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

 is a symplectic form. Assigning a symplectic form to 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 is referred to as giving 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 a symplectic structure.
Let

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2n}.}

 We define our symplectic form ω on this basis as follows:
In this case the symplectic form reduces to a simple quadratic form. If In denotes the n × n identity matrix then the matrix, Ω, of this quadratic form is given by the 2n × 2n block matrix:
Let 



Q


{\displaystyle Q}

 be a smooth manifold of dimension 



n


{\displaystyle n}

. Then the total space of the cotangent bundle 




T

Q


{\displaystyle T^{*}Q}

 has a natural symplectic form, called the Poincaré two-form or the canonical symplectic form
Here

 are any local coordinates on 



Q


{\displaystyle Q}

 and 



(

p

{\displaystyle (p_{1},\ldots ,p_{n})}

 are fibrewise coordinates with respect to the cotangent vectors 



d

{\displaystyle dq^{1},\ldots ,dq^{n}}

. Cotangent bundles are the natural phase spaces of classical mechanics.  The point of distinguishing upper and lower indexes is driven by the case of the manifold having a metric tensor, as is the case for Riemannian manifolds. Upper and lower indexes transform contra and covariantly under a change of coordinate frames.  The phrase "fibrewise coordinates with respect to the cotangent vectors" is meant to convey that the momenta 




p

i




{\displaystyle p_{i}}

 are "soldered" to the velocities 



d

{\displaystyle dq^{i}}

. The soldering is an expression of the idea that velocity and momentum are colinear, in that both move in the same direction, and differ by a scale factor.
A Kähler manifold is a symplectic manifold equipped with a compatible integrable complex structure. They form a particular class of complex manifolds. A large class of examples come from complex algebraic geometry. Any smooth complex projective variety 



V
⊂


C
P


n




{\displaystyle V\subset \mathbb {CP} ^{n}}

 has a symplectic form which is the restriction of the Fubini—Study form on the projective space 





C

{\displaystyle \mathbb {CP} ^{n}}

.
Riemannian manifolds with an 



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }

-compatible almost complex structure are termed almost-complex manifolds. They generalize Kähler manifolds, in that they need not be integrable.  That is, they do not necessarily arise from a complex structure on the manifold.
There are several natural geometric notions of submanifold of a symplectic manifold 



(
M
,
ω
)


{\displaystyle (M,\omega )}

:
One major example is that the graph of a symplectomorphism in the product symplectic manifold (M × M, ω × −ω) is Lagrangian. Their intersections display rigidity properties not possessed by smooth manifolds; the Arnold conjecture gives the sum of the submanifold's Betti numbers as a lower bound for the number of self intersections of a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, rather than the Euler characteristic in the smooth case.

The cotangent bundle of a manifold is locally modeled on a space similar to the first example. It can be shown that we can glue these affine symplectic forms hence this bundle forms a symplectic manifold. A less trivial example of a Lagrangian submanifold is the zero section of the cotangent bundle of a manifold. For example, let 
Then, we can present

in the condition for a Lagrangian submanifold

and all others vanishing.
As local charts on a symplectic manifold take on the canonical form, this example suggests that Lagrangian submanifolds are relatively unconstrained. The classification of symplectic manifolds is done via Floer homology—this is an application of Morse theory to the action functional for maps between Lagrangian submanifolds. In physics, the action describes the  time evolution of a physical system; here, it can be taken as the description of the dynamics of branes.
Another useful class of Lagrangian submanifolds occur in Morse theory. Given a Morse function 



f
:
M
→

R



{\displaystyle f:M\to \mathbb {R} }

 and for a small enough 



ε


{\displaystyle \varepsilon }

L


{\displaystyle L}

 is called special if in addition to the above Lagrangian condition the restriction 




Ω

 is vanishing. In other words, the real part

. The following examples are known as special Lagrangian submanifolds,
The SYZ conjecture deals with the study of special Lagrangian submanifolds in mirror symmetry; see (Hitchin 1999). 
The Thomas–Yau conjecture predicts that the existence of a special Lagrangian submanifolds on Calabi–Yau manifolds in Hamiltonian isotopy classes of Lagrangians is equivalent to stability with respect to a stability condition on the Fukaya category of the manifold.
A Lagrangian fibration of a symplectic manifold M is a fibration where all of the fibres are Lagrangian submanifolds. Since M is even-dimensional we can take local coordinates (p1,…,pn, q1,…,qn), and by Darboux's theorem the symplectic form ω can be, at least locally, written as ω = ∑ dpk ∧ dqk, where d denotes the exterior derivative and ∧ denotes the exterior product. This form is called the Poincaré two-form or the canonical two-form. Using this set-up we can locally think of M as being the cotangent bundle

 This is the canonical picture.
Let L be a Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold (K,ω) given by an immersion i : L ↪ K (i is called a Lagrangian immersion). Let π : K ↠ B give a Lagrangian fibration of K. The composite (π ∘ i) : L ↪ K ↠ B is a Lagrangian mapping. The critical value set of π ∘ i is called a caustic.
Two Lagrangian maps (π1 ∘ i1) : L1 ↪ K1 ↠ B1 and (π2 ∘ i2) : L2 ↪ K2 ↠ B2 are called Lagrangian equivalent if there exist diffeomorphisms σ, τ and ν such that both sides of the diagram given on the right commute, and τ preserves the symplectic form.[4] Symbolically:
where τ∗ω2 denotes the pull back of ω2 by τ.
