Z,
Z, or z, is the 26th and last letter of the Latin alphabet, as used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its usual names in English are zed (/Ààz…õd/) and zee (/ÀàziÀê/), with an occasional archaic variant izzard (/Àà…™z…ôrd/).[1]
In most English-speaking countries, including Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom, the letter's name is zed /z…õd/, reflecting its derivation from the Greek letter zeta (this dates to Latin, which borrowed Y and Z from Greek), but in American English its name is zee /ziÀê/, analogous to the names for B, C, D, etc., and deriving from a late 17th-century English dialectal form.[2]
Another English dialectal form is izzard /Àà…™z…ôrd/. This dates from the mid-18th century and probably derives from Occitan iz√®da or the French √©zed, whose reconstructed Latin form would be *idzƒìta,[1] perhaps a Vulgar Latin form with a prosthetic vowel. Its variants are still used in Hong Kong English and Cantonese.[3]
Other languages spell the letter's name in a similar way: zeta in Italian, Basque, and Spanish, seta in Icelandic (no longer part of its alphabet but found in personal names), z√™ in Portuguese, z√§ta in Swedish, z√¶t in Danish, zet in Dutch, Indonesian, Polish, Romanian, and Czech, Zett in German (capitalised as a noun), zett in Norwegian, z√®de in French, zetto („Çº„ÉÉ„Éà) in Japanese, and z√©t in Vietnamese. Several languages render it as /ts/ or /dz/, e.g. tseta /tseta/ or more rarely tset /tset/ in Finnish (sometimes dropping the first t altogether; /seta/, or /set/ the latter of which is not very commonplace). In Standard Chinese pinyin, the name of the letter Z is pronounced [ts…®], as in "zi", although the English zed and zee have become very common. In Esperanto the name of the letter Z is pronounced /zo/.
Under the NATO spelling alphabet, the letter is signified with ZULU, like the Zulu people.
The Semitic symbol was the seventh letter, named zayin, which meant "weapon" or "sword". It represented either the sound /z/ as in English and French, or possibly more like /dz/ (as in Italian zeta, zero).
The Greek form of Z was a close copy of the Phoenician Zayin (), and the Greek inscriptional form remained in this shape throughout ancient times. The Greeks called it zeta, a new name made in imitation of eta (Œ∑) and theta (Œ∏).
In earlier Greek of Athens and Northwest Greece, the letter seems to have represented /dz/; in Attic, from the 4th century BC onwards, it seems to have stood for /zd/ and /dz/ ‚Äì there is no consensus concerning this issue.[4] In other dialects, such as Elean and Cretan, the symbol seems to have been used for sounds resembling the English voiced and voiceless th (IPA /√∞/ and /Œ∏/, respectively). In the common dialect (koine) that succeeded the older dialects, Œ∂ became /z/, as it remains in modern Greek.
The Etruscan letter Z was derived from the Phoenician alphabet, most probably through the Greek alphabet used on the island of Ischia. In Etruscan, this letter may have represented /ts/.
The letter Z was borrowed from the Greek Zeta, most likely to represent the sound /tÕ°s/. At c. 300 BC, Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor, removed the letter Z from the alphabet, allegedly due to his distaste for the letter, in that it "looked like the tongue of a corpse". A more likely explanation is the sound had disappeared from Latin, making the letter useless for spelling Latin words. It is also thought due to rhotacism, Z became a trilled R sound, /r/. Whatever the case may be, Appius Claudius' distaste for the letter Z is today credited as the reason for its removal. A few centuries later, after the Roman Conquest of Greece, Z was again borrowed to spell words from the prestigious Attic dialect of Greek.
Before the reintroduction of z, the sound of zeta was written s at the beginning of words and ss in the middle of words, as in s≈çna for Œ∂œéŒΩŒ∑ "belt" and trapessita for œÑœÅŒ±œÄŒµŒ∂ŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ "banker".
In some inscriptions, z represented a Vulgar Latin sound, likely an affricate, formed by the merging of the reflexes of Classical Latin /j/, /dj/ and /gj/:[example needed] for example, zanuariu for ianuariu "January", ziaconus for diaconus "deacon", and oze for hodie "today".[5] Likewise, /di/ sometimes replaced /z/ in words like baptidiare for baptizare "to baptize". In modern Italian, z represents /ts/ or /dz/, whereas the reflexes of ianuarius and hodie are written with the letter g (representing /d í/ when before i and e): gennaio, oggi. In other languages, such as Spanish, further evolution of the sound occurred.
Old English used S alone for both the unvoiced and the voiced sibilant. The Latin sound imported through French was new and was not written with Z but with G or I. The successive changes can be seen in the doublet forms jealous and zealous. Both of these come from a late Latin zelosus, derived from the imported Greek Œ∂·øÜŒªŒøœÇ z√™los. The earlier form is jealous; its initial sound is the [d í], which developed to Modern French [ í]. John Wycliffe wrote the word as gelows or ielous.
Z at the end of a word was pronounced ts, as in English assets, from Old French asez "enough" (Modern French assez), from Vulgar Latin ad satis ("to sufficiency").[6]
In earlier times, the English alphabets used by children terminated not with Z but with & or related typographic symbols.[7] In her 1859 novel Adam Bede, George Eliot refers to Z being followed by & when her character Jacob Storey says, "He thought it [Z] had only been put to finish off th' alphabet like; though ampusand would ha' done as well, for what he could see."[8]
Some Latin based alphabets have extra letters on the end of the alphabet. The last letter for the Icelandic, Finnish and Swedish alphabets is √ñ, while it is √Ö for Danish and Norwegian. In the German alphabet, the umlauts (√Ñ/√§, √ñ/√∂, and √ú/√º) and the letter √ü (Eszett or scharfes S) are regarded respectively as modifications of the vowels a/o/u and as a (standardized) variant spelling of ss, not as independent letters, so they come after the unmodified letters in the alphabetical order. The German alphabet ends with z.
A glyph variant of Z originating in the medieval Gothic minuscules and the Early Modern Blackletter typefaces is the "tailed z" (German geschw√§nztes Z, also Z mit Unterschlinge). In some Antiqua typefaces, this letter is present as a standalone letter or in ligatures. Ligated with long s (≈ø), it is part of the origin of the Eszett (√ü) in the German alphabet. The character ezh (∆∑) resembles a tailed z, which came to be indistinguishable from the yogh (»ù) in Middle English writing.

There is also a variant with a stroke.
In modern English orthography, the letter ‚ü®z‚ü© usually represents the sound /z/.
It represents / í/ in words like seizure. More often, this sound appears as ‚ü®su‚ü© or ‚ü®si‚ü© in words such as measure, decision, etc. In all these words, / í/ developed from earlier /zj/ by yod-coalescence.
Few words in the Basic English vocabulary begin or end with ‚ü®z‚ü©, though it occurs within other words. It is the least frequently used letter in written English,[9] with a frequency of about 0.08% in words.
‚ü®z‚ü© is more common in the Oxford spelling of British English than in standard British English, as this variant prefers the more etymologically 'correct' -ize endings, which are closer to Greek, to -ise endings, which are closer to French; however, -yse is preferred over -yze in Oxford spelling, as it is closer to the original Greek roots of words like analyse. The most common variety of English it is used in is American English, which prefers both the -ize and -yze endings. One native Germanic English word that contains 'z', freeze (past froze, participle frozen) came to be spelled that way by convention, even though it could have been spelled with 's' (as with choose, chose and chosen).
‚ü®z‚ü© is used in writing to represent the act of sleeping (often using multiple z's, like zzzz), as an onomatopoeia for the sound of closed-mouth human snoring.[10]
‚ü®z‚ü© stands for a voiced alveolar or voiced dental sibilant /z/, in Albanian, Breton, Czech, Dutch, French, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovak, and the International Phonetic Alphabet. It stands for /tÕ°s/ in Chinese pinyin and Jyutping, Finnish (occurs in loanwords only), and German, and is likewise expressed /ts/ in Old Norse. In Italian, it represents two phonemes, /tÕ°s/ and /dÕ°z/. In Portuguese, it stands for /z/ in most cases, but also for /s/ or / É/ (depending on the regional variant) at the end of syllables. In Basque, it represents the sound /s/.
Castilian Spanish uses the letter to represent /Œ∏/ (as English ‚ü®th‚ü© in thing), though in other dialects (Latin American, Andalusian) this sound has merged with /s/. Before voiced consonants, the sound is voiced to [√∞] or [z], sometimes debbucalized to […¶] (as in the surname Guzm√°n […°u√∞Ààman], […°uzÀàman] or […°u…¶Ààman]). This is the only context in which ‚ü®z‚ü© can represent a voiced sibilant [z] in Spanish, though ‚ü®s‚ü© also represents [z] (or […¶], depending on the dialect) in this environment.
In Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, ‚ü®z‚ü© usually stands for the sound /s/ and thus shares the value of ‚ü®s‚ü©; it normally occurs only in loanwords that are spelt with ‚ü®z‚ü© in the source languages.
The letter ‚ü®z‚ü© on its own represents /z/ in Polish. It is also used in four of the seven officially recognized digraphs: ‚ü®cz‚ü© (/tÕ° Ç/), ‚ü®dz‚ü© (/dÕ°z/ or /tÕ°s/), ‚ü®rz‚ü© (/ ê/ or / Ç/, sometimes it represents a sequence /rz/) and ‚ü®sz‚ü© (/ Ç/), and is the most frequently used of the consonants in that language. (Other Slavic languages avoid digraphs and mark the corresponding phonemes with the h√°ƒçek (caron) diacritic: ‚ü®ƒç‚ü©, ‚ü®ƒè‚ü©, ‚ü®≈ô‚ü©, ‚ü®≈°‚ü©; this system has its origin in Czech orthography of the Hussite period.) ‚ü®z‚ü© can also appear with diacritical marks, namely ‚ü®≈∫‚ü© and ‚ü®≈º‚ü©, which are used to represent the sounds / ë/ and / ê/. They also appear in the digraphs ‚ü®d≈∫‚ü© (/dÕ° ë/ or /tÕ°…ï/) and ‚ü®d≈º‚ü© (/dÕ° ê/ or /tÕ° Ç/).
Hungarian uses ‚ü®z‚ü© in the digraphs ‚ü®sz‚ü© (expressing /s/, as opposed to the value of ‚ü®s‚ü©, which is  É), and ‚ü®zs‚ü© (expressing  í). The letter ‚ü®z‚ü© on its own represents /z/.
In Modern Scots ‚ü®z‚ü© is used in place of the obsolete letter ‚ü®»ù‚ü© (yogh) and should be pronounced as a hard 'g'. Whilst there are a few common nouns which use ‚ü®z‚ü© in this manner, such as brulzie (pronounced 'brulgey' meaning broil), z as a yogh substitute is more common in people's names and place-names. Often the names are mispronounced to follow the apparent English spelling so Mackenzie is commonly pronounced with a 'z' sound. Menzies, however, still retains the correct pronunciation of 'Mingus'.
Among non-European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet, ‚ü®z‚ü© usually stands for [z], such as in Azerbaijani, Igbo, Indonesian, Shona, Swahili, Tatar, Turkish, and Zulu. ‚ü®z‚ü© represents [dÕ°z] in Northern Sami and Inari Sami. In Turkmen, ‚ü®z‚ü© represents [√∞].
In the Nihon-shiki, Kunrei-shiki, and Hepburn romanisations of Japanese, ‚ü®z‚ü© stands for a phoneme whose allophones include [z] and [dz]. Additionally, in the Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki systems, ‚ü®z‚ü© is used to represent that same phoneme before /i/, where it's pronounced [dÕ° ë ~  ë].
A graphical variant of ‚ü®z‚ü© is ‚ü® í‚ü©, which has been adopted into the International Phonetic Alphabet as the sign for the voiced postalveolar fricative.
On the QWERTZ keyboard used in Central Europe the Z replaces the Y of the standard US/UK QWERTY keyboard as the sixth letter of the first row.
