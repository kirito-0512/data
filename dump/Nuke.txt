A nuke is a weapon that can be used to destroy large areas, these weapons are very powerful but are not used very often. the biggest nuke blast ever created was from the tsar bomb, it was 50 megatons explosion and the blast radius was 21 miles. the bomb also inflected large radiation which spread to civilian areas by wind. but the tsar bomb was never used in warfare because it was more effective to drop a bunch of smaller nukes.
