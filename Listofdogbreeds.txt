Listofdogbreeds,

This list of dog breeds includes both extant and extinct dog breeds, varieties and types. A research article on dog genomics published in Science/AAAS defines modern dog breeds as "a recent invention defined by conformation to a physical ideal and purity of lineage".[1]
Note: not all dogs listed below are recognized breeds by an official breed registry that can certify the dog is a purebred, including The Kennel Club (TKC - 1873), the oldest and first official dog breed registry in the world, located in the United Kingdom,[2] and the three oldest breed registries in North America, and largest in the world, including the American Kennel Club (AKC - 1884),[3][4] United Kennel Club (UKC - 1898),[5] and Canadian Kennel Club (CKC - 1888).[6]
