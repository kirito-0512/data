Micah,
Micah (/ˈmaɪkə/; Hebrew: מִיכָה‎, Modern: Mikha, Tiberian: Mîḵā) is a given name.
Micah is the  name of several people in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), and means "Who is like God?" The name is sometimes found with theophoric extensions. Suffix theophory in Yah and in Yahweh results in Michaiah or Michaihu (Hebrew: מִיכָיְהוּ‎, Modern: Mikhayhu, Tiberian: Mîḵā́yhû), meaning who is like Yahweh?[1] Suffix theophory in El results in Michael (Hebrew: מִיכָאֵל‎, Modern: Mikha'el, Tiberian: Mîḵāʼēl), meaning "who is like god".
In German and Dutch, Micah is spelled Micha and the ch in the name is pronounced either [ʃ] or [x]; the first is more common in female names, the latter in male names. The name is not as common as Michael or Michiel.
