2001,
2001 (MMI) was a common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar, the 2001st year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 1st  year of the 3rd millennium and the 21st century, and the  2nd   year of the 2000s decade. 2001 was dominated by the September 11 attacks against the United States by Al-Qaeda, which killed 2,977 people and instigated the global war on terror.[1][2] The United States led a multi-national coalition in an invasion of Afghanistan after the Taliban government did not extradite Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. 
Internal conflicts, political or otherwise, caused shifts in leadership in multiple countries, which included the assassination of Laurent-Désiré Kabila in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,[3] the Second EDSA Revolution in the Philippines,[4] the massacre of the royal family by the crown prince in Nepal,[5] and civil unrest in Argentina.[6] Other notable political events were an escalation in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict,[7] the storming of the Indonesian parliament,[8] the Hainan Island incident between China and the United States,[9] an insurgency in Macedonia,[10] and a terrorist attack on the Parliament of India that began the 2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff.[11]

The number of global refugees in 2001 was approximately 12 million. 500,000 were settled over the course of the year, but the same number of people were displaced in other locations, causing the number of refugees to remain largely unchanged. The largest sources of refugees were from Afghanistan and Macedonia. The number of internally displaced persons decreased from 21.8 million to 19.8 million in 2001, with the most affected areas being Afghanistan, Colombia, and Liberia.[25]
There were 34 active armed conflicts in 28 countries in 2001, the total numbers remaining unchanged from 2000. The majority of these conflicts took place in Africa and Asia; 14 occurred in Africa and 13 occurred in Asia. Three new armed conflicts emerged in 2001, in Macedonia, the Central African Republic, and Afghanistan.[26]
The 2001 insurgency in Macedonia began on January 22 when the National Liberation Army (NLA) attacked a police station in Tearce, about 15 kilometres (9 mi) from the border with Kosovo, which escalated what had been smaller skirmishes along the border. The Battle of Tetovo was the first major offensive of the insurgency, launched by the NLA on March 14.[27] Tetovo would remain a major area of conflict for the duration of the insurgency.[28] Attempts to reach a ceasefire were interrupted in June.[29] The Ohrid Agreement was signed on August 13,[30] and the deployment of NATO peacekeeping forces to Macedonia was authorized on August 21.[10] In Yugoslavia, the related insurgency in the Preševo Valley by Albanian rebels escalated on February 5.[31] The Končulj Agreement, signed in May, mandated a ceasefire and resulted in the full demilitarization, demobilization, and disarmament of the Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac (UÇPMB).[32]
The Second Congo War continued with the assassination of President Laurent-Désiré Kabila on January 16.[3] The Angolan Civil War moved toward peace talks in 2001, but talks were challenged by attacks on civilians by UNITA,[33] including a train bombing on August 10 that killed 252 people.[34] The insurgency following the Second Chechen War continued in Chechnya, prompting Russia to respond with the Alkhan-Kala operation on June 25.[35] The War of the Peters continued into 2001 as a conflict between two commanders within the larger Second Sudanese Civil War, going on until a ceasefire was negotiated in August.[36] The Bandaranaike Airport attack was a deadly attack by the Tamil Tigers that took place as part of the ongoing Eelam War III in Sri Lanka.[37] The Provisional Irish Republican Army began disarmament in October following decades of paramilitary attacks during the Troubles.[38]
Two failed coup attempts took place in 2001: a group of junior officers sought to overthrow President Pierre Buyoya in Burundi while he was out of the country on April 18,[39] and André Kolingba, a former president of the Central African Republic, led a military coup against his successor Ange-Félix Patassé on May 28, causing several days of violence.[40]
The 2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff was the only notable conflict between two national governments in 2001;[26] it began on December 13 after an attack on the Parliament of India by Pakistani militants.[11] There were also border clashes between India and Bangladesh in April.[41] Enforcement of the Iraqi no-fly zones led to air strikes against Iraq in February and August by the United States and the United Kingdom.[42]
The Second Intifada marked increased conflict between Israel and Palestine in 2001 when terrorists affiliated with Hamas carried out suicide bombings and other attacks on Israeli citizens.[7][43] The Israeli government responded with temporary occupations,[7] targeted killings,[44] and its first use of airstrikes against Palestine since 1967.[45] The Israeli and Palestinian governments agreed to a ceasefire on September 19.[46]
The September 11 attacks by Al-Qaeda took place when 19 terrorists hijacked four commercial airplanes and crashed two of them into the World Trade Center, one into the Pentagon, and one near Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania. 2,977 people were killed; the attacks and the subsequent global war on terror were events that defined 2001.[1][2][47] The United States demanded that the Taliban extradite Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and end state-sponsored terrorism in Afghanistan. When these demands were not met, the United States led a multi-national coalition in the invasion of Afghanistan on October 7, intensifying the ongoing Afghan Civil War.[48]
The first major offensive by American and Northern Alliance forces resulted in the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif on November 10.[49] The Northern Alliance took control of the city of Herat during an uprising on November 12,[50] and Al-Qaeda surrendered the Afghan capital Kabul on November 13.[51] The Taliban surrendered in Kandahar on December 6.[52] The United States and its allies attacked the Al-Qaeda headquarters in Tora Bora in December, but Osama bin Laden escaped before the cave complex was captured by the forces on December 17.[53] An interim government of Afghanistan led by Hamid Karzai was formed on December 22.[54]

A minor economic decline took place among many developed economies in 2001. The United States saw a recession from March to November after a correction of the dot-com bubble, an over-valued tech industry. Further economic disruption occurred in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.[91] European economies also saw stalled growth in 2001,[92] with Germany entering a brief recession toward the end of the year.[93] Argentina's years-long economic crisis reached its peak in December when a bank run prompted the freezing of deposits, in turn causing widespread social unrest and the resignation of the President of Argentina.[94] Overall, 2001 marked a decline in international trade by about 1.5%, which was a significant contrast from the 11% increase in 2000. This was the first negative growth in international trade since 1982. IT industries and the dot-com crash are attributed for the decline in trade.[95]
