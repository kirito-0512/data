RouseHistoryofMathematics,
One of Wikipedia's public domain resources!
There are a series of articles transcribed by Dr. David R. Wilkins (dwilkins@maths.tcd.ie)
School of Mathematics Trinity College, Dublin 
at http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/
They all start with a line:
From `A Short Account of the History of Mathematics' (4th edition, 1908) by W. W. Rouse Ball. 
Are they fair game to grab as source material for our wikipedia?
I know we are scarfing stuff from the 1911 encyclopedia, this is from 1908, so it should be under the same lack of restrictions....
.... discussion about sending an email, email is written, time elapses ...

These are great! I'll kick things off by putting a tracking index here:

Mathematicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries from A Short Account of the History of Mathematics by W. W. Rouse Ball (4th Edition, 1908).

The following list, it appears, is not actively maintained. Use {{Rouse History of Mathematics}} to put a credit in an usual manner." -- Taku 00:31, 15 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]
By judging from red links (their absence), all entries that can be used to create stubs have been imported. -- Taku 01:06, 15 September 2005 (UTC)Reply[reply]
