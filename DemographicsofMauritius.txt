DemographicsofMauritius,
Demographic features of the population of Mauritius include population density, ethnicity, education level, the health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population.
Mauritian society includes people from many different ethnic groups as well as a significant population of mixed-race people who have ancestry from more than one ethnic group. A majority of the republic's residents are the descendants of people from India. Mauritius also contains substantial populations from continental Africa, China, France ,and the East African island nation of Madagascar.
Indo-Mauritians make up approximately sixty-six percent of the population. The Indo-Mauritian population consists of Hindu, Muslim and Christian descendants of Indian laborers.
Mauritian Creoles (descendants of Africans) make up twenty-eight percent of the population.[1] Today, a significant proportion of Creoles are of African descent with varying amounts of French and Indian ancestry. The creole community also includes the country's ‘Metisse’ or mixed-race communities which consist of people with any admixture of the island's other groups.[2] Rodrigues and Chagossians are usually incorporated within the Creole ethnic group.
Franco-Mauritians (Mauritians of French ancestry) form around two percent of the population.[citation needed] They are descendants of French settlers, comprising the largest group of European origin.[citation needed] There is a smaller population of British descent, most of whom have been absorbed into the Franco-Mauritian community.[citation needed] There is also a considerable number of white foreign expatriates living in Mauritius, about 8,000 from France and 2,000 from South Africa.[citation needed] Along with the French European community, there is a small number of British expatriates or people of British descent in Mauritius.[3][4]
Sino-Mauritians from the Hakka and other Chinese sub-ethnic/linguistic groups make up around three percent of Mauritian society.[5]
While the government officially groups Mauritians in four ethnic groups –  Hindus, Muslims, Chinese, and General Population – the general population includes all who do not practice the Hindu or Muslim religion or are not Chinese by ethnicity. Hence the general population is the Christian community, which includes Creoles, mixed people, white people, and those who have converted to Christianity. The exception is that the general population does not include the Christian Chinese, although most practice a mix of Christianity and traditional Chinese religions.[citation needed]
Small groups of foreign students from Europe or the Indian Ocean region are also present. Recent years have seen a steady flow of foreign workers into the textile industry (primarily Chinese women), the construction industry (primarily Indian workers), and harbor-related activities (primarily Taiwanese men). Immigration policy does not provoke much debate in Mauritius, and the relative economic stability of the island serves to attract foreign workers.[citation needed]
According to the 2022 revision of the World Population Prospects[6][7] the total population was 1,298,915 in 2021, compared to 479,000 in 1950.[8]
The proportion of the population aged under 15 was 21.9% in 2010.[8] 71.2% were between 15 and 65 years of age, with 6.9% being 65 years or older.[8]

The main languages spoken in Mauritius are English, French, Mauritian Creole, and Bhojpuri.[14] There is no official language. English is the official language of the parliament, though French is also permitted. However, the lingua franca is Mauritian Creole and the newspapers and television programs are usually in French.[15] The Mauritian currency features the Latin, Tamil and Devanagari scripts.
Mauritian Creole, which is spoken by 90 percent of the population, is considered to be the native language of the country and is used most often in informal settings.[14] It was developed in the 18th century by African slaves who used a pidgin language to communicate with each other as well as with their French masters, who did not understand the various African languages. The pidgin evolved with later generations to become a casual language.[16]
Mauritian Creole is a French-based creole.
In 2015, the population was estimated to be 48.5% Hindu, 27.2% Roman Catholic, 17.5% Muslim, 3.9% No religion and unspecified, 2.5% Protestantism, 0.4% Other religions.[17]
More than 90% of the Sino-Mauritian community are Christian; the remainder are largely Buddhist.[5]
According to the United Nations, there were 28,713 international migrants in Mauritius in 2017.
