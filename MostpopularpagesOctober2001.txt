The following list is the most popular pages for October, 2001.  This is based on a fairly ad hoc method of adjusting for unique visitors.
It is perhaps noteworthy that such a large percentage of the most popular pages have something to do with the terrorist attacks and aftermath, including the war.  SEE BELOW -- I have also produced a hand-edited list, omitting the war-related topics.
Hand edited to remove terrorist attack and war related pages.
I suppose my judgment could be questioned on some of the choices I've made, but I just wanted to give the gist of it.  (For example, New York City might have been a popular topic anyway, but I removed it. And perhaps the interest in Religion and World War II is related to the attacks, but I left them in.)
