Conjunctionelimination,
In propositional logic, conjunction elimination (also called and elimination, ∧ elimination,[1] or simplification)[2][3][4] is a valid immediate inference, argument form and rule of inference which makes the inference that, if the conjunction A and B is true, then A is true, and B is true. The rule makes it possible to shorten longer proofs by deriving one of the conjuncts of a conjunction on a line by itself. 
An example in English:
The rule consists of two separate sub-rules, which can be expressed in formal language as:
and
The two sub-rules together mean that, whenever an instance of "
P
∧
Q
{\displaystyle P\land Q}
" appears on a line of a proof, either "
P
{\displaystyle P}
" or "
Q
{\displaystyle Q}
" can be placed on a subsequent line by itself. The above example in English is an application of the first sub-rule.
The conjunction elimination sub-rules may be written in sequent notation:
and
where 
⊢
{\displaystyle \vdash }
 is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
P
{\displaystyle P}
 is a syntactic consequence of 
P
∧
Q
{\displaystyle P\land Q}
 and 
Q
{\displaystyle Q}
 is also a syntactic consequence of 
P
∧
Q
{\displaystyle P\land Q}
 in logical system;
and expressed as truth-functional tautologies or theorems of propositional logic:
and
where 
P
{\displaystyle P}
 and 
Q
{\displaystyle Q}
 are propositions expressed in some formal system.
