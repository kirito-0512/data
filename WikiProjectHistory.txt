Significant milestones for this WikiProject:
WikiProject History has developed several structural features to help manage our work:
The goals of this wikiproject are: a)  to improve Wikipedia's coverage of history by creating, expanding, and maintaining history-related articles. b) to provide guidelines and recommendations for articles that describe all aspects of history. c) to serve as the central point of discussion for issues related to history in Wikipedia, d)  to maintain the history portal and its sub-portals, e) to answer queries about history on the reference desk, especially the humanities reference desk.
The entire subject and Wikipedia's coverage of it is intended to be summarized in the Outline of history and its branch outlines.  These are in turn is part of Wikipedia's outline system which is one of Wikipedia's main contents systems. Please see the article Outline of history. Please look this over and fill-in missing topics.If Wikipedia has an article or article section about those topics, please add links to them.
While analyzing the outline, please answer the following questions (and fix the outline as needed):
The overall purpose of the outline is to help readers comprehend the subject by showing what belongs to it, and within the subject what belongs to what.The outline is a taxonomy of the subject, and also serves as a table of contents and navigation aid to browse Wikipedia's articles (and article sections) about the subject.
It is also a useful tool for the WikiProject to analyze, plan, develop, and revise history-related material.  It is a hub from which to organize historical topics.
It was built as a "reverse outline", a structural model of an existing work, which in addition to being a summary of the work, can reveal the gaps and other weaknesses for revision purposes.Please help improve it. It's our bird's eye view.Thank you.
Most articles within Category:History and its sub-categories are within our scope. There are already several other history projects with more specific scopes so the majority of our work is on articles that do not seem to fall into other projects' scopes. For further clarification:
As of 8 July 2023, there are 46,986 articles within the scope of WikiProject history, of which 336  are featured.  This makes up 0.7% of the articles on Wikipedia and 3.22% of featured articles and lists.  Including non-article pages, such as talk pages, redirects, categories, etcetera, there are 139,688  pages in the project.
The list of history topics lists of basic history topics are some articles that are in this project's scope. The latter list is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject, but rather an overview.  The Lists of topics are intended to be comprehensive and to include links to every article related to the subject on Wikipedia.  See List of mathematics topics and List of psychology topics as examples.
A number of lists and meta-lists are maintained in Wikipedia:
The list of basic history topics is intended to provide an overview of the coverage of history on Wikipedia.  It is rapidly becoming one of the best history browsing tools on Wikipedia. The List of history topics page provides a history link for every subject for which there is a list on that page, still has some redlinks. Some of those redlinks can be edited to point to existing article sections (in the main article for the corresponding subject), while the rest need articles or sections created so that they can be pointed to them.

Articles for creation
The goal of this project is to serve as an active resource, where other editors can seek help or get questions answered, or get help with any topical efforts they may be working on. and also, at some point, we will try to resume various basic wikiproject tasks such as article assessment, working on group projects. to that end, we may create some sort of list here of active volunteers, or editors, or just anyone who can occasionally take a little time to answer questions, help with various tasks and efforts.

Working Groups at WikiProject History: 
Assessment ·
Collaboration ·

Outreach ·
Task forces
The Assessment Working Group  finds historical articles for the first time and rates them on quality and importance scales.
Current active members:
(Please feel free to add your name to join!!)
The Collaboration working group serves to improve articles that have been assessed by the assessment department by assigning large groups of editors to improve those articles. Help can be requested for an article you are working on or you have found abandoned. A list of open tasks can also be found in a section above. 
Current active members:
(Please feel free to add your name to join!!)

The Review working group carries out peer reviews on historical articles and nominates articles for good and featured status. It also carries out A-Class reviews on articles within our scope.

Informal subgroups are any individual subgroup that any editor wishes to set up, on an informal or formal basis, for the purpose of gathering any group of editors together. This will be to enable editors to form their own subgroups for working with and communicating with other editors, but without taking on the formal roles and responsibilities of an official task force.
These subgroups could be formed based on any criteria at all. so any editor could form a subgroup for communicating with editors who are new to this topical area. or it could be an informal group for brainstorming ideas for a particular topic, or a particular editing drive, or group effort, or for a specific effort to delve into a particular topic, or to set up a single new article or set of articles, or for any other reason.
Our reason for setting up this new type of subgrouping is simple; history is a very broad and varied field. We would like to encourage all editors to take an active role here, as much as they might wish. so if you wish to set up any such subgroup, please feel free to post a notice on the talk page. We will be glad to help to promote any such efforts here. thanks!!
Task forces are where the major work of the WikiProject gets done.
We will have Task Forces set up here to  write about each of the topical areas covered by WikiProject History.
Please choose a Task Force below that matches the area that you most wish to work on. If you don't see an area listed that you want to work on, then please feel free to simply add it. thanks!!!!

Infobox Historical Event
The Infobox {{Infobox historical event}} should be added to the pages of notable events.

{{Infobox historical event}}
Country/Region history
A navbox from Category:History by region navigational boxes should be added to History of a 'x' country pages.
Other useful info boxes and  templates can be found in the category: Category:History and events templates.
The following articles have been selected for inclusion in one or more release versions of Wikipedia. Please help ensure that these articles remain of the highest possible quality.
The following articles have all been featured in the Main page Did You Know section:
Every article on a historical topic should be assigned to as specific a sub-category under the Category:History as possible, as well as to any non-history categories to which it belongs. Since Wikipedia has tens of thousands of articles on historical subjects, they shouldn't all be placed directly in Category:History; there is an elaborate hierarchy of historical categories, described here, and only the lowest-level category need be assigned.
Category tree
Organization of Category:History
Category:History contains only the most general articles, such as History and Human history. Other historical articles appear in one or more sub-categories
Category names
The category for the history of the modern nation X should be called "History of X" or "History of the X" and included.
Few nations have neat histories: most have changed name, constitution and boundaries over their history. This section gives advice on creating sub-categories to reflect these changes.
Using the United Kingdom as an example:
Here's an incomplete diagram showing these historical categories and how they relate in the category system:
(This diagram is far from complete: there is a Category:British Empire, not shown. Category:History of the United Kingdom is in Category:United Kingdom and so on. And there are many sub-categories. But it illustrates the principles.)
Don't over-categorize
Having added an article to, say, Category:Military history of the United Kingdom, there's no need to also add that article to Category:Military history, Category:History of the United Kingdom, Category:United Kingdom or Category:History. The category hierarchy expresses the fact that every article about the military history of the UK is an article about military history and an article about the UK.
