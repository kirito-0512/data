Coherencelength,
In physics, coherence length is the propagation distance over which a coherent wave (e.g. an electromagnetic wave) maintains a specified degree of coherence.  Wave interference is strong when the paths taken by all of the interfering waves differ by less than the coherence length. A wave with a longer coherence length is closer to a perfect sinusoidal wave. Coherence length is important in holography and telecommunications engineering.
This article focuses on the coherence of classical electromagnetic fields.  In quantum mechanics, there is a mathematically analogous concept of the quantum coherence length of a wave function.
In radio-band systems, the coherence length is approximated by
where 
c
{\displaystyle \,c\,}
 is the speed of light in vacuum, 
n
{\displaystyle \,n\,}
 is the refractive index of the medium, and 
Δ
f
{\displaystyle \,\mathrm {\Delta } f\,}
 is the bandwidth of the source or 
λ
{\displaystyle \,\lambda \,}
 is the signal wavelength and 
Δ
λ
{\displaystyle \,\Delta \lambda \,}
 is the width of the range of wavelengths in the signal.
In optical communications and optical coherence tomography (OCT), assuming that the source has a Gaussian emission spectrum, the roundtrip coherence length 
L
{\displaystyle \,L\,}
 is given by 
where 
λ
{\displaystyle \,\lambda \,}
 is the central wavelength of the source, 
n
g
{\displaystyle n_{g}}
 is the group refractive index of the medium, and 
Δ
λ
{\displaystyle \,\mathrm {\Delta } \lambda \,}
 is the (FWHM) spectral width of the source. If the source has a Gaussian spectrum with FWHM spectral width 
Δ
λ
{\displaystyle \mathrm {\Delta } \lambda }
, then a path offset of 
±
L
{\displaystyle \,\pm L\,}
 will reduce the fringe visibility to 50%.  It is important to note that this is a roundtrip coherence length — this definition is applied in applications like OCT where the light traverses the measured displacement twice (as in a Michelson interferometer).  In transmissive applications, such as with a Mach–Zehnder interferometer, the light traverses the displacement only once, and the coherence length is effectively doubled.
The coherence length can also be measured using a Michelson interferometer and is the optical path length difference of a self-interfering laser beam which corresponds to

 fringe visibility,[3] where the fringe visibility is defined as
where 
I
{\displaystyle \,I\,}
 is the fringe intensity.
In long-distance transmission systems, the coherence length may be reduced by propagation factors such as dispersion, scattering, and diffraction.
Multimode helium–neon lasers have a typical coherence length on the order of centimeters, while the coherence length of longitudinally single-mode lasers can exceed 1 km. Semiconductor lasers can reach some 100 m, but small, inexpensive semiconductor lasers have shorter lengths, with one source[4] claiming 20 cm. Singlemode fiber lasers with linewidths of a few kHz can have coherence lengths exceeding 100 km. Similar coherence lengths can be reached with optical frequency combs due to the narrow linewidth of each tooth. Non-zero visibility is present only for short intervals of pulses repeated after cavity length distances up to this long coherence length.
Tolansky's An introduction to Interferometry has a chapter on sources which quotes a line width of around 0.052 angstroms for each of the Sodium D lines in an uncooled low-pressure sodium lamp, corresponding to a coherence length of around 67 mm for each line by itself.[5] Cooling the low pressure sodium discharge to liquid nitrogen temperatures increases the individual D line coherence length by a factor of 6.  A very narrow-band interference filter would be required to isolate an individual D line.
