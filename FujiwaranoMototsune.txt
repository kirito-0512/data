Fujiwara no Mototsune (藤原 基経, 836 – February 25, 891), also known as Horikawa Daijin (堀川大臣), was a Japanese statesman, courtier and aristocrat of the early Heian period.[1] He was the first kampaku, a regent of an adult emperor, in Japanese history.
He was born the third son of Fujiwara no Nagara, but was adopted by his powerful uncle Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, who had no sons. Mototsune followed in Yoshifusa's footsteps, holding power in the court in the position of regent for four successive emperors.
Mototsune invented the position of kampaku regent for himself in order to remain in power even after an emperor reached maturity. This innovation allowed the Fujiwara clan to tighten its grip on power right throughout an emperor's reign.
Mototsune is referred to as Shōsen Kō (昭宣公) (posthumous name as Daijō Daijin).
This member of the Fujiwara clan was the son of Fujiwara no Nagara, who was one of the brothers of Fujiwara no Yoshifusa.  Mototsune was adopted as son and heir of Yoshifusa.[4]  In other words, Yoshifusa was Mototsune's uncle, and father through adoption.[5]
He was married to a daughter of Imperial Prince Saneyasu (son of Emperor Ninmyō).
