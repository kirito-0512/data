The governor of Montana is the head of government of Montana[2] and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.[3] The governor has a duty to enforce state laws,[2] the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Montana State Legislature,[4] to convene the legislature at any time,[5] and to grant pardons and reprieves.[6]
Montana has had 24 governors, consisting of 9 Republicans and 15 Democrats. The longest-serving governor was Joseph Toole, who served from 1889 to 1893 and again from 1901 until his resignation in 1908 with 11 years in office. He is the only governor to serve nonconsecutive terms. The shortest-serving governor was Elmer Holt, who served less than 13 months when the previous governor died. The current governor is Republican Greg Gianforte, who took office on January 4, 2021.
Montana Territory was organized from Idaho Territory on May 26, 1864.[7] During its 35-year history, it had nine governors appointed by the president of the United States.
Montana was admitted to the Union on November 8, 1889.[44]
The current Montana Constitution, ratified in 1972, calls for a 4-year term for the governor, commencing on the first Monday in January following an election.[45] A 1992 amendment limits the governor to 8 years in any 16-year period.[46] The constitution provides for the election of a lieutenant governor for the same term as the governor. The two offices are elected on the same ticket;[45] a provision which did not appear in the state's first constitution, ratified in 1889. In the event of a vacancy in the office of governor due to resignation, disqualification, or death, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term. If the governor is unable to perform his duties for any other reason, the lieutenant governor may become acting governor at the discretion of the state legislature.[47]
