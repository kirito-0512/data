Nanosecond,
A nanosecond (ns) is a unit of time in the International System of Units (SI) equal to one billionth of a second, that is, 1⁄1 000 000 000 of a second, or 10−9 seconds.
The term combines the SI prefix nano- indicating a 1 billionth submultiple of an SI unit (e.g. nanogram, nanometre, etc.) and second, the primary unit of time in the SI.
A nanosecond is equal to 1000 picoseconds or 1⁄1000 microsecond.  Time units ranging between 10−8 and 10−7 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of nanoseconds.
Time units of this granularity are commonly found in telecommunications, pulsed lasers, and related aspects of electronics.
