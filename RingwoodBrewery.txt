Ringwood Brewery is a small brewery on the edge of the New Forest in Hampshire, England, near the Dorset border. It produces mainly cask ales and some bottled beers.
The emblem for the brewery is a boar.
There are records from the early 19th century of four breweries, one owned by a banker named Stephen Tunks, that stood on the site of the present day Ringwood Brewery. Of the four, none survive today. The last to close was Carters on West Street, in 1923.
In 1975 the former head brewery of Hull Brewery, Peter Austin retired to Hampshire to enjoy more time sailing. However the retirement was not to last and Austin was keen to pursue new ventures.[2][3]
In 1978, Ringwood Brewery was established and started brewing in an old bakery at Minty's Yard, New Street, Ringwood in April of that year.[4] Austin was an influence on Britain's craft brewery rebirth in much the same way that Fritz Maytag of San Francisco's Anchor Brewing Company and Pierre Celis of Belgium's Hoegaarden Brewery were to their countries. However, Austin had a much more direct role in brewery development through his consulting business and equipment sales. Several American craft brewers use his equipment: Geary's Brewing, Shipyard and Middle Ages Brewing Company.
Austin later brought in two business partners; David and Nigel Welch. The business continued to expand with the purchase of a number of pubs[3] and in 1986, having outgrown their existing brewery, the company moved to the a stie on Christchurch Road, historically previously part of Stephen Tunk's Brewery.[4]
In 1988, the brewery was awarded 'Champion Beer of Britain' by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), for 'Old Thumper'.[5]
Between 1990 and 1994 production rose from 5,000 barrels per annum to 13,000 barrels per annum. The brewhouse was extended to accommodate this from 1994, with a further extension taking place in 1999 to allow more than one brew per day.[5]
In 2007, Ringwood was purchased from David Welch by Marston's plc for £19.2 million.[3] Marston's stated that they would keep the brewery in operation and continue producing the full range of Ringwood beers.[6][7][8]
In 2013, Ringwood underwent a full re-brand, and the ABV of Old Thumper was reduced from 5.6% to 5.1%.
In 2015, Ringwood Best Bitter was rebranded as Ringwood Razorback.[5]
In May 2020, it was announced that subject to competition law and shareholder approval, Marston's would merge its brewing business, including Ringwood Brewery, with Carlsberg UK (the United Kingdom arm of Carlsberg Group), into a joint venture to be known as Carlsberg Marston's Brewing Company (CMBC), valued at £780m. Marston's took a 40% stake in the joint venture and received c.£273m in cash.[9]
In 2023 the brewery and its brands were put up for sale by CMBC, who announced the closure of their logistics base in Ringwood as part of the same announcement.[10]
