The 8th century BCE started the first day of 800 BC and ended the last day of 701 BC. The 8th century BC is a period of great change for several historically significant civilizations.  In Egypt, the 23rd and 24th dynasties lead to rule from Nubia in the 25th Dynasty.  The Neo-Assyrian Empire reaches the peak of its power,  conquering the Kingdom of Israel as well as nearby countries.
Greece colonizes other regions of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Rome is founded in 753 BC, and the Etruscan civilization expands in Italy. The 8th century BC is conventionally taken as the beginning of Classical Antiquity, with the first Olympiad set at 776 BC, and the epics of Homer dated to between 750 and 650 BC.
Iron Age India enters the later Vedic period. Vedic ritual is annotated in many priestly schools in Brahmana commentaries, and the earliest Upanishads mark the beginning of Vedanta philosophy.
(Although other ancient civilizations such as Greece and Egypt & other Eastern societies had been counting their centuries on lunar and solar cycles. And have mentioned lunar eclipses and solar eclipses on tabloids.
The mentioned solar eclipse lasted longer than previous records)
