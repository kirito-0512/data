Wikipediholismtest,

If you're not sure whether you are a Wikipediholic or are unsure about the amount of Wikipedihol you took, then you should take this test. Be prepared to take at least 17.5 minutes because there are about 200 questions. The point value of answering "yes" to each question is listed in parentheses () at the end of the question. The higher the result, the more Wikipedihol you had! New questions and modifications are of course welcomeâ€”good questions are those that measure current addiction (e.g., "have you edited a page in the last week?", not "have you ever edited a page?"), on the hypothesis that Wikipediholism can be cured, or at least controlled to some degree. New questions should be added as #ENTRY (point value, additional notes) in order to be compatible with the automated version. There's an automated version if you don't want to add up the score yourself; legacy and modern versions are also available.
You don't get any points for these questions, since they may be redundant or not provide a good measure of current addiction.  However the answers may provide useful information for your health worker:
You can use the {{User Wikipediholic}} template to display your score on your user page, using {{User Wikipediholic|(your score)|(revision id)}}.
