Homepage,
A home page (or homepage) is the main web page of a website.[1] The term may also refer to the start page shown in a web browser when the application first opens.[2] Usually, the home page is located at the root of the website's domain or subdomain. For example, if the domain is example.com, the home page is likely located at www.example.com/.
A home page is the primary web page that a visitor will view when they navigate to a website via a search engine, and it may also function as a landing page to attract visitors.[3] In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages.
Good home page design is usually a high priority for a website;[4] for example, a news website may curate headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles.[5][6] According to Homepage Usability, the homepage is the "most important page on any website" and receives the most views of any page.[7] A poorly designed home page can overwhelm and deter visitors from the site.[6] One important use of home pages is communicating the identity and value of a company.[8]
A homepage is oftentimes designed to catch attention, and as such, important elements are positioned at the top in a strict hierarchy of importance.[9] Curating which content to display on a homepage, as to not overwhelm visitors, is important to a well-designed page.[10]
One of the commonly found aspects of a homepage is a hero image, a large eye-catching banner image often containing a photograph or drawing depicting the webpage owner's values, services, etc. as a message.[11][12] Hero images are immediately visible above the fold, without scrolling the page down.[13] A hero image may have several complementary elements as an overlay, such as the website's logo, a call to action, and a brief description.
A website with a wide hero image.
Homepage featuring a prominent hero image with logo and description overlaid.
A biographical website with a full-sized image.
A descendant of the hero image is a carousel, also known as a slider. It is a slideshow-like element of the homepage with multiple images rotating every few seconds.[14] Carousels are frequently accompanied by dots and buttons in order to select different images.[15] Carousels are generally made using JavaScript but can also be made through CSS animations.[16] In 2013, carousels were a popular element of a homepage, with 52% of top e-commerce websites using the design feature. However, in 2016 only 32% of websites used one.[17]
