ListofprimeministersofJapan,

The Prime Minister of Japan is the chief minister of the government of Japan, and the head of the Japanese Cabinet. This is a list of prime ministers of Japan, from when the first Japanese prime minister (in the modern sense), Itō Hirobumi, took office in 1885, until the present day.
32 prime ministers under the Meiji Constitution had a mandate from the Emperor. The "electoral mandates" shown are for the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Imperial Diet, which was not constitutionally guaranteed to have any influence on the appointment of the prime minister.
Currently, the prime minister under the Constitution of Japan shall be designated from among the members of the National Diet, and shall be appointed by the Emperor after being nominated by the National Diet.
The incumbent prime minister is Fumio Kishida.
The office of Daijō-daijin (太政大臣, Chancellor of the Realm of Japan) was the equivalent of what would become the office of prime minister. It was an ancient role which had been discontinued in the 18th century and briefly revived during the Meiji era.
The office of Daijō-daijin was abolished in December 1885 with the appointment of Itō Hirobumi in the new position of prime minister of Japan (内閣総理大臣, Naikaku Sōri-Daijin).
Of the 63 past prime ministers, six served more than 5 years while twenty served less than a year. Shinzo Abe is the longest-serving prime minister, serving for over 8 years. Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni is the shortest-serving prime minister, resigning after eight weeks. Itō Hirobumi is the only person to have served on four separate occasions. Katsura Tarō is the longest-serving prime minister in the Imperial period (1885-1947) and the only person to have served on three separate occasions.
