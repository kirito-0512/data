Dear everyone:
It is now possible to subscribe to receive a Wikipedia article each day (or however often we decide to have the article sent out).
It works like this.  Each day, Wikipedia's article-a-day script looks at the above queue, identifies the first article that it has not previously sent out, and then sends that article out, as a plain text file, to all subscribers to the mailing list.  We will not abuse your e-mail address--it will be used for this feature only.  We hate spam even more than you do, if possible.
Wikipedians, please feel free to add to the queue, in the above format (with the underlines), by way of saying, "Thanks, great article!"  Please don't delete old, previously-sent articles from the list; they won't be sent again.
