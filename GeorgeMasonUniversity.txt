George Mason University (George Mason, Mason, or GMU) is a public research university in Fairfax County, Virginia.[8] The university was originally founded in 1949 as a Northern Virginia regional branch of the University of Virginia. Named after Founding Father of the United States George Mason in 1959, it became an independent university in 1972. The school has since grown into the largest public university in the Commonwealth of Virginia.[9][10][1] Mason operates four campuses and one retreat-conference center in Virginia - in Fairfax, Arlington, Front Royal, Prince William, and Lorton[11] respectively -, as well as a campus in Incheon, South Korea. The flagship campus is in Fairfax.
The university is classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".[12] Two professors were awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics during their time at George Mason University: James M. Buchanan in 1986 and Vernon L. Smith in 2002.[13]
EagleBank Arena, a 10,000-seat arena and concert venue operated by the university, is located on the Fairfax campus. The university recognizes 500 student groups as well as 41 fraternities and sororities.
In 1949, the University of Virginia created an extension center to serve Northern Virginia.[14][1] The extension center offered both for credit and non-credit informal classes in the evenings at various pre-existing venues.[1]: 5  The first for credit classes offered were: "Government in the Far East, Introduction to International Politics, English Composition, Principles of Economics, Mathematical Analysis, Introduction to Mathematical Statistics, and Principles of Lip Reading."[1]  By the end of 1952, enrollment was 1,192 students.[1]
A resolution of the Virginia General Assembly in January 1956 changed the extension center into University College, the Northern Virginia branch of the University of Virginia.[15][self-published source?] John Norville Gibson Finley served as director.[16] Seventeen freshmen students attended classes at University College in a small renovated elementary school building in Bailey's Crossroads starting in September 1957.[17] In 1958 University College became George Mason College.[15]
The City of Fairfax purchased and donated 150 acres (60 hectares) of land just south of the city limits to the University of Virginia for the college's new site, which is now referred to as the Fairfax Campus. In 1959, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia selected a permanent name for the college: George Mason College of the University of Virginia. The Fairfax campus construction planning that began in early 1960 showed visible results when the development of the first 40 acres (16 hectares) of Fairfax Campus began in 1962. In the Fall of 1964 the new campus welcomed 356 students.[18][self-published source?]
During the 1966 Session of the Virginia General Assembly, Alexandria delegate James M. Thomson, with the backing of the University of Virginia, introduced a bill in the General Assembly to make George Mason College a four-year institution under the University of Virginia's direction. The measure, known as H 33,[19] passed the Assembly easily and was approved on March 1, 1966, making George Mason College a degree-granting institution. During that same year, the local jurisdictions of Fairfax County, Arlington County, and the cities of Alexandria and Falls Church agreed to appropriate $3 million to purchase land adjacent to Mason to provide for a 600-acre (240-hectare) Fairfax Campus with the intention that the institution would expand into a regional university of major proportions, including the granting of graduate degrees.[citation needed]
In 1972, Virginia separated George Mason College from the University of Virginia at Charlottesville and renamed it George Mason University.[20]
In 1978, George W. Johnson was appointed to serve as the fourth president.[21] Under his eighteen-year tenure, the university expanded both its physical size and program offerings at a tremendous rate.[21][22] Shortly before Johnson's inauguration in April 1979, Mason acquired the School of Law and the new Arlington Campus. The university also became a doctoral institution.[21] Toward the end of Johnson's term, Mason would be deep in planning for a third campus in Prince William County at Manassas. Major campus facilities, such as Student Union Building II, EagleBank Arena, Center for the Arts, and the Johnson Learning Center, were all constructed over the course of Johnson's eighteen years as University President. Enrollment once again more than doubled from 10,767 during the fall of 1978 to 24,368 in the spring of 1996.[23]
Alan G. Merten was appointed president in 1996. He believed that the university's location made it responsible for both contributing to and drawing from its surrounding communities—local, national, and global. George Mason was becoming recognized and acclaimed in all of these spheres. During Merten's tenure, the university hosted the World Congress of Information Technology in 1998,[24] celebrated a second Nobel Memorial Prize-winning faculty member in 2002, and cheered the Men's Basketball team in their NCAA Final Four appearance in 2006. Enrollment increased from just over 24,000 students in 1996 to approximately 33,000 during the spring semester of 2012, making Mason Virginia's largest public university and gained prominence at the national level.[25]
Ángel Cabrera officially took office on July 1, 2012. Both Cabrera and the board were well aware that Mason was part of a rapidly changing academia, full of challenges to the viability of higher education. In a resolution on August 17, 2012, the board asked Cabrera to create a new strategic vision that would help Mason remain relevant and competitive in the future. The drafting of the Vision for Mason, from conception to official outline, created a new mission statement that defines the university.[26]
On March 25, 2013, university president Ángel Cabrera held a press conference to formally announce the university's decision to leave the Colonial Athletic Association to join the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10). The announcement came just days after the Board of Visitors' approval of the university's Vision document that Cabrera had overseen. Mason began competition in the A-10 during the 2013–2014 academic year, and Mason's association with the institutions that comprise the A-10 started a new chapter in Mason athletics, academics, and other aspects of university life.[27] The Chronicle of Higher Education listed Mason as one of the "Great Colleges to Work For" from 2010 to 2014.[28] The Washington Post listed Mason as one of the "Top Workplaces" in 2014.[29] The WorldatWork Alliance for Work-Life Progress awarded Mason the Seal of Distinction in 2015.[30] The AARP listed Mason as one of the Best Employers for Workers Over 50 in 2013.[31] Phi Beta Kappa established a chapter at the university in 2013.[32]
In 2018, a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit revealed that conservative donors, including the Charles Koch Foundation and Federalist Society, were given direct influence over faculty hiring decisions at the university's law and economics schools. GMU President Ángel Cabrera acknowledged that the revelations raised questions about the university's academic integrity and pledged to prohibit donors from sitting on faculty selection committees in the future.[33]
Cabrera resigned his position on July 31, 2019, and became president of Georgia Tech.[34][35] Following Cabrera's resignation, Anne B. Holton served as interim president until June 30, 2020.[35]
On February 24, 2020, the Board of Visitors appointed Gregory Washington as the eighth president. He started at George Mason on July 1, 2020. Washington is the university's first African-American president.[36]
On March 23, 2020, George Mason shifted to exclusively online instruction during the COVID pandemic.  Hybrid instruction occurred for the Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Fall 2021 semesters. The university offered a combination of online and in-person instruction.[37]
George Mason University has four campuses in the United States, all within the Commonwealth of Virginia.[38] Three are in the Northern Virginia suburbs of the Washington metropolitan area, and one is in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains.[38] The university also has one campus in South Korea, in the Songdo International Business District of Incheon.[39][38] Between 2005 and 2009 the university had a campus at Ras al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates.[40] The Blue Ridge campus, just outside Front Royal, is run in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution.[41]
The university's Fairfax Campus is situated on 677 acres (274 hectares) of landscaped land with a large pond in a suburban environment in George Mason, Virginia, just south of the City of Fairfax in central Fairfax County.

The bronze statue of George Mason on campus[b] was created by Wendy M. Ross and dedicated on April 12, 1996.[53] The 71/2 foot statue shows George Mason presenting his first draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights which was later the basis for the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights. Beside Mason is a model of a writing table that is still in the study of Gunston Hall, Mason's Virginia estate. The books on the table—volumes of Hume, Locke and Rousseau—represent influences in his thought.[citation needed]
The Arlington Campus is situated on 5.2 acres (2.1 hectares) in Virginia Square, a bustling urban environment on the edge of Arlington County, Virginia's Clarendon business district and four miles (6.4 km) from downtown Washington, D.C. The campus was founded in 1979 with the acquisition of a law school.[54] In 1998, Hazel Hall opened to house the George Mason University School of Law (now Antonin Scalia Law School); subsequent development created Van Metre Hall (formerly Founders Hall), home of the Schar School of Policy and Government,[55] the Center for Regional Analysis,[56] and the graduate-level administrative offices for the School of Business.[57] Vernon Smith Hall houses the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution, the Mercatus Center, and the Institute for Humane Studies. The campus also houses the 300-seat Founders Hall Auditorium.[citation needed]

George Mason University has been subject to controversy surrounding donations from the Charles Koch Foundation, in particular to the College of Humanities and Social Sciences’ Department of Economics,[150][151][152] which was seen as being allegedly influenced by libertarian political thought, evidenced by the political activities of the Koch brothers. University documents revealed that the Koch brothers were given the ability to pick candidates as a condition of monetary donations.[151] George Mason University altered its donor rules following the controversy.[153]
The naming of the Antonin Scalia Law School after the late conservative United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the hiring of conservative United States Supreme Court Justices Bret Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas as professors, the allegedly “lavish treatments,” speaking gigs, and "all-experiences-paid" travel arrangements they received, its close ties with the  Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, and the extensive provision of professional development and continuing education programs, as well as speaking engagements for sitting judges of lower and appellate divisions has brought on controversy on the university over conservative political influence at the law school.[154] [155][156][157][158][159][160]
George Mason University’s public policy school and political science department, the Schar School of Policy and Government, received some controversy with its relationship with former intelligence agency personnel of the United States Intelligence Community, in particular the 2009 hiring of General Michael Hayden, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence - Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the hiring of Robert Deitz, former General Counsel of the NSA, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), Senior Counsel to the Director of the CIA, and the Deputy General Counsel for Intelligence at the U.S. Department of Defense due to their alleged role in mass surveillance including the NSA warrantless surveillance programs of 2001-2007 and other similar ethical criticisms.[161] [162]
