Cytoprotection,
Cytoprotection is a process by which chemical compounds provide protection to cells against harmful agents.[1]
A gastric cytoprotectant is any medication that combats ulcers not by reducing gastric acid but by increasing mucosal protection.[2] Examples of gastric cytoprotective agents include prostaglandins which protect the stomach mucosa against injury by increasing gastric mucus secretion. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins and thereby make the stomach more susceptible to injury.[3]  Gastric cytoprotective drugs include carbenoxolone, deglycyrrhizinised liquorice, sucralfate (aluminium hydroxide and sulphated sucrose), misoprostol (a prostaglandin analogue), bismuth chelate (tri-potassium di-citrato bismuthate) and zinc L-carnosine.
