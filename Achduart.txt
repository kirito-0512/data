Achduart,
Achduart (Gaelic: Achadh Dhubhaird[1]) is a coastal hamlet in Coigach, Wester Ross in northwestern Scotland, now within the Highland council area.[2][3] It is situated about 4Â km southeast of the village of Achiltibuie, at the end of a minor road. A footpath continues on to the hamlet of Culnacraig, then along the coast past Ben More Coigach to Strathcanaird.[4] 
Achduart has accommodation facilities for tourists, who come for its proximity to the sea and its seclusion and remoteness. There is a hostel in Acheninver, a short distance to the north, formerly run by the Scottish Youth Hostels Association. [5]
The name of Achduart comes from the Gaelic for "the field at the black headland".[1] Achduart was part of the Estate of Coigach, Lochbroom, belonging to the Countess of Cromartie.[6]
The dominant geographical feature in the area is Cairn Conmheall, which rises to 541 metres.
